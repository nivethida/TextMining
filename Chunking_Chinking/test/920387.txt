mercistheman	379	January 11, 2015, 08:36:47 AM	At this time I am pleased to spend on BTC... the infrastructure advances and Microsoft endorsement (plus many others) sways me to believe it is now a safe bet.. the cost is not a high risk today... jump in the water is warm; 
newIndia	1386	January 11, 2015, 08:54:46 AM	275 USD... hmmm... BitStamp has increased the selling pressure again. I'd rather invest in bitcoin business than directly into bitcoin.
Q7	448	January 11, 2015, 09:02:24 AM	Looks like the price is on the downtrend. I expected it to breach 300 usd towards the weekend and then progress upwards further but instead have made a u-turn. Who knows what is going to happen next. Would rather wait for now. 
Braedo	70	January 11, 2015, 09:16:07 AM	Is it though? Seems we are taking huge hits then levelling then another hit and so on. I haven't dumped any of my coins but I am not convinced I should be buying more at the moment. I think we may have abit further to fall.
kingcolex	1414	January 11, 2015, 09:20:34 AM	Bitcoin is a risky investment and always will be no matter the use, if tons of companies are using it and instantly dumping it for fiat and people are buying it at the constantly dumped price it is hard to figure what worth of a coin will be.
mercistheman	379	January 11, 2015, 09:25:38 AM	No regrets... if you don't believe it will at least surpass $400 by the end of the year then you have small hones.{ChangeLine}The purchase today is for the long run... $275 is better spent on the future than a hotel and & decent meal.

Would rather wait for now. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It is weekend, plus people are worried about the destiny of the Bitstamp stolen coins, plus the trial of Ullbricht.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I see no reason for a up move right now, but in few days things might change

That's not bad at all , It is time to buy yea {ChangeLine}but I would say it will go down more again before it will rise like hell (when the halving happens on 2016){ChangeLine}Still... weird why the price didn't rise again after Bitsmap is back to work , I don't get it . I thought Bitsmap getting hacked was the reason of the fall of the price

15Lemon714	266	January 11, 2015, 04:09:15 PM	If you buy keep buying what you can afford in smaller amounts over the next few months, it has not hit the bottom yet imo but i also believe its not reached its peak and it wont for a few years atleast

So?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}At this point it's worth buying no matter how much "sell pressure" there is.

If folks don't believe it will eventually bring back a decent return maybe they should only invest in low risk minimal return ventures.{ChangeLine}Buying is the best way to ensure long term health.

cryptocult live	37	January 11, 2015, 05:25:59 PM	Gonna come down to double digits. Buy for 80$ later in the year. Maybe even 50$.

I gave a friend a kindle fire for Christmas and it took her exactly two days to sit on it and break it in half. I haven't even paid the credit card bill I used to buy it yet. FML

FandangledGizmo	1050	January 11, 2015, 06:25:24 PM	The best time to buy Bitcoin imo is as soon as you hear that there is a 'bail-in' in a major country. Cyprus was huge for Bitcoin and at the time Bitcoin was not very well known. A major bail-in now would make Bitcoin go to the moon.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The reason is Bitcoin is obviously immune from that but people don't really appreciate it until a big event happens in a 'safe' country that makes them realise their money is less safe in a bank. When that happens people all around the world will rush into Bitcoin

Longterm growth is broken. Inflation gives shortsellers an advantage over buyers until an equilibrium will be reached. Right now costs of the btc network are 1 million USD every day. This number will have to come down to probably 10% which would still be high but a bit more reasonable. So 30$ for a coin is reasonable as costs of the network would still be 100k$ every day. Given we have speculators in the market who are buying at low prices i think 50$ could go in. This is only if the core-bagholders don't loose faith in which case bitcoin could go back to single digits. {ChangeLine}An increased interest from the public and inflow of new money can not be expected in a big way with this past performance. So we will have to hit rockbottom (inflation = constant demand), stagnate there for a bit before we can start a new bullmarket, likely not before 2016. {ChangeLine}To break it down to one sentence: costs of running the network are outsizes with the current inflationrate, so it's not flying, or in case it is flying it's flying more like a bird with a broken wing. Sellpressure is a constant factor and will not go away with 3600 new coins created every day. 2015 will be the year for low inflation coins (with a more efficient network) to shine to which group LTC and BTC do not belong yet or anytime soon. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quote from: FandangledGizmo on January 11, 2015, 06:25:24 PMThe best time to buy Bitcoin imo is as soon as you hear that there is a 'bail-in' in a major country.

Running from fiat-inflation to a coin with high inflation isn't a thing that makes a lot sense.
