NotLambchop	378	January 14, 2015, 09:16:21 PM	TL;DR:{ChangeLine}This d00d here  after an involantary committment to a mental hospital, keeps a self-moderated thread where he doles out financial advice grooms and exploits vulnerable, economically naive victims1 and convinces them to hold the BTC which he himself accnowledges cashing out from.{ChangeLine}Since the thread is self-moderated and I was asked not to post in it, I'm starting this one--without self-moderation, where I might reply.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}1. An evangelising Christian woman currently experiencing family tensions due to re-buying BTC that her husband has sold.{ChangeLine}BitChick now:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quote from: BitChick on January 14, 2015, 08:15:44 PMQuote from: rpietila on January 14, 2015, 05:19:08 PMQuote from: Wandererfromthenorth on January 14, 2015, 05:06:38 PMBitcoiners want to get billionaires quick with their little scheme, call noobs that are trying to get out of the mess late "greedy".{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It is no secret that I sold some at $675 in 2013. The next exit zone starts earliest at $3,000, probably higher.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It is no greed to sell at a bottom, it is just stupid. Stuff is as valuable as a year ago (or more, due to more adoption, etc.), yet 75% cheaper. This is a game and you are offered 4 times better odds than last time when you took them. Instead of taking them now, or holding, you decide to fold.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}If anyone becomes a billionaire with bitcoin, he deserves it. So many chances of folding were offered but he held on.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}There is voice of reason in the midst of so much babbling nonsense. ;Thanks Risto. ; ;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I am having to argue a bit with BitchicksHusband a little about not folding right now though. ; I guess it is hard not to get emotional. ;We did have to sell some of our holdings in December but bought back a little last week. ;I think the hardest thing to wrap my brain around is the fact that BTC should be so much more valuable with all of the infrastructure that has been put into place during 2014. ;Why hasn't some of the money used to build this infrastructure been used to boost the price up a bit? ;Aren't these companies at all concerned about BTC users getting disillusioned and leaving BTC completely? ;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The extent of batshit craziness:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quote from: rpietila on January 14, 2015, 08:29:02 PMQuote from: NotLambchop on January 14, 2015, 05:39:32 PMSimply pointing out that you are taking financial advice from a man recently released from a mental institution {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Yes, and guess what? There is no law that compels me to mention it. I do it voluntarily, for my reasons. After going through this, and many other experiences, I know some things about how the world operates. People are able to learn it from my writings, but you can never learn very much if it is not verified by experience.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}My dealings with the government started in 2005, by my reading of some conspiracist literature, which seemed to be alarmingly truthful when I compared it to the things I saw happening in the world. Already in 2008 I was so dangerous that an armed team of 8 guys was sent to my home at daybreak. Then came seizures and many court cases. Many perceive that Finland is a lawful country, with lawbreakers punished and law also granting rights to people. Well, miles of laws we have here, but if they are not expedient for the situation at hand, they can be broken by judges. I lost the recognition towards the judicial system after they too many times mistreated me, even against their own laws.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}If I believed in my rights, I could have the hospitalization order re-examined, since the law requires me to be "dangerous to myself or others" for such procedure to take effect. Everyone knows that I have never hit another person, nor had a thought or word of hurting myself for over a decade. The only thing I am dangerous against, is the banking cartel. But I already know from experience that the judicial system is capable of straight-faced delivery of any verdict. So raising these matters in court does not help. Raising them here makes fools cry out: "look the guy's just come out from a nuthouse", but it's not the fools for whom I write, it is the wise - the people who understand things, and are here for learning, and contributing themselves.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}If something in the above disqualifies me from being read, there's the "Ignore" button for that. Thank you.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}In turn, I feel it a chore that your messages need to be "open"ed first before deletion, so please don't post. Thank you.{ChangeLine}

You don't see it because your government is your all-inclusive udder. But look at the people from whom the money to feed you is coming. They need it.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}All this libertarian claptrap is a red herring used to pump the price. ;Early adopters have major baggage that need greater fools to dump on.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The only thing anyone should look at when investing REAL money is the price action. ;Bitcoin is a bubble that is deflating. ;Anyone taking your advice would have been losing money. ;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}He thread banned me cause I called him out on being wrong about the price action and trying to divert the topic to "freedoms". ;Yet people here still following this nut case because he got lucky ONCE

NotLambchop	378	January 14, 2015, 09:26:44 PM	What's funny is I can't make up a story any more ludicrous than his reality.{ChangeLine}Imagine getting dragged off to a mental hospital after belligerently accusing the owners and staff of a luxury hotel of theft? ;You know what the theft was? ;An unsecured MacBook left by him in a sauna where he was entertaining his friends, the other "Supernodes." ;Batshit crazy. ;Paranoia, delusions of persecution, delusions of grandeur, full-blown mania--it's in there.{ChangeLine}And people LISTEN TO HIM.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}That poor BitChick woman is probably going to get divorced from [or worse, beaten by] her husband if she doesn't stop. ;Crazyness.

riiiiising	266	January 14, 2015, 09:42:14 PM	He made one good call in 2012 when he first invested, and since then, he's basically always wrong. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Calling the bottom at $500:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=740394.0{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}And the monthly trend line that he no longer updates. Hmm, wonder why...?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=322058.0{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}He now operates as a confidence man, and suckers in the economically illiterates into believing they're making a wise decisions to buy his bitcoin bags from him. Right down to the way that he uses a picture of himself as his avatar, in a suit and tie. And of course, like all con men, he can't respond to any criticism because he knows he's wrong, so instead he bans people from this threads and deletes any posts which don't look favorable to him. Unfortunately for him, some of us have a memory of more than +/- two days and can call him out on his bullshit.
Warren Buffert	280	January 14, 2015, 09:44:26 PM	Why am I not surprised that most bitcoin bulltards are also 9/11 troothers? It's apparent that an aversion to reality is required to be a believer in bitcoin at this point.

Risto has been running a scam on this page for years now with not only BTC, but several alts (particularly Ripple).

Miz4r	1232	January 14, 2015, 10:24:47 PM	I don't think personal attacks on anyone here should be respected or allowed. Rpietila has done nothing wrong except being a bit extravagant sometimes and being a megabull on Bitcoin for the long term. This is who he is, and I think he is often hilarious and funny. Whether someone chooses to listen or believe him is up to them. I like to believe we are all adults who can form our own opinion about matters and we certainly don't need someone like Lambchop watching out for us and warn us. Also why are you meddling in the affairs of Bitchick and her husband? I'm sure they are very much capable of handling their financial matters and their relationship themselves. In any case it's none of your business and talking about it the way you do just shows how low of a man you really are. Disgusting. That's all I have to say about this.

At no time any inexperienced person should make a statement like that, be it just a harassing technique. We all have specific personality traits more or less prominent. For example, people in here might me more paranoid than the rest but that doesn't mean they're pathological.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Paranoia is a thought process believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of irrationality and delusion.[1] Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs, or beliefs of conspiracy concerning a perceived threat towards oneself (e.g. "Everyone is out to get me"). [Wikipedia]{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It is paranoid to think that "someone is after you" if there is no evidence whatsoever that it is indeed the case.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}But hey, just a small list what the different government institutions have done to me:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}- 2008 Armed raid by Customs to my home and office at dawn, seizure of all my&company valuable assets, copying all my data from my computer, illegally censoring the investigation report, illegally prolonging the seizure, no charges, no apology. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}- 2011-12 The Financial Supervisory Authority has learned about a stock offering from one of my companies. Illegally deciding that secondary market is subject to initial emission rules, illegally deciding that multiple sellers count as one, after those twists deciding that the company (sic) has broken their law because the multiple-page prospectus was not certified by the authorities. The company was no part in any of the transactions,; did not receive any of the proceeds, it was a private deal. The company was ordered to redeem all the shares that the buyers want to sell, at the original price of the deal, which many did, since 12 months had passed from the deal and the share price was down in the meantime. (It's a bit technical to explain but this alone was such Kafkan 1984esque fuckery that it really gave me the feeling that is described as paranoia when it is not accompanied with actual deeds by the government institutions){ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}- 2011-12 Finland decides it's time to apply Finnish law to my Estonian company, Silverbank. Due to the Finnish law that forbids the word "pankki" (meaning: "bank") to be used in a context that could mislead the clients to believe that an uncertified financial institution is a regulated bank, I get sued to the court and fined for the crime of "calling Silverbank a bank even though it is not".{ChangeLine}Problems with the procedure:{ChangeLine}- not guilty (instead of calling Silverbank a bank, during the entire time of the court procedure as well as before, the first sentence in our landing page was "Silverbank is not a bank. ...") The technique of turning the truth diametrically upside down, accusing you of doing exactly what you are trying to avoid to do, claiming that you are calling it a bank when the website says exactly the opposite, was previously known to me only from books as a method of driving you crazy in brainwash camps. {ChangeLine}- no jurisdiction (company is Estonian){ChangeLine}- only misleading use is forbidden - Silverbank did not accept deposits, grant loans or do anything that the regulated banks do, no overlap in any of the services; claiming that someone could in these conditions be unintentionally mislead to believe it is a regulated "pankki" is hogwash.{ChangeLine}- law says only Finnish word "pankki" is subject to restriction, extension to foreign languages in foreign companies as part of their trademark, is complete perversion of justice.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}- 2013 Denied access to bitcoin conference, thrown to mental facility instead, for the reason that my stories about bitcoin and recent happenings sounded unbelievable (nevertheless true, but that does not seem to count), there a member of staff came to my room without knocking about an hour after the silence, got enraged for seeing me awake, drugged me, and later that night proceeded to steal money from my locked closet with his reserve keys, even later bragged that he has done it constantly over 30 years and never has the client been believed. When I reported, they let me understand that the only one suffering from such a report is me, because it is a further proof that I am deluded. My position, without access to phone, computer, Internet, lawyer, visitors, regular diet, on forced medication, was such weak that I decided to skip it and then later on tell about it to a bigger audience. Revenge belongs to God, but it would be cool to have this guy locked in for his crimes against the weakest and most vulnerable.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}(All cases where the perpetrator organization is not exactly known, and are therefore subject to interpretations, are left out. Neither are any civil cases counted. The above is in no way all the strange things that have happened to me. Attorney-at-law Matti Valtonen has served me for over 10 years and can testify to that {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Could they just possibly leave me alone? It is not about money, I am not that rich, and pay my taxes. It is about freedom. Thinking is outlawed. Writing to public fora is dangerous. It was my following and reporting the 2008 "bank crisis" (self-inflicted liquidity issue used as a pretense for more bankster power grab) too closely that got me into trouble in the first place. Still, I never had any proprietary information, no inside sources, nothing. Just public stuff from the 'net! Clearly the government has grown too big if they have time to harass people who recompile public information. Clearly the bankster influence in the government has grown too big if they can make it break its own laws, multiple times, to be able to conduct the harassment efficiently.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The same thing has never happened twice. So don't be too surprised if you hear something strange in connection with me. Compare the sources though. Even I may not always be the most reliable source because if under duress or drugged, it's hard to think clearly.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}If there's something strange going on, I will try to have plausible deniability as follows:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quote from: rpietila on May 20, 2013, 11:59:03 AMGENERAL ORDER N:O 357 CONCERNING THE ACTIVITIES OF RPIETILA SUPERNODE{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}HELSINKI 2013, MAY 20, 15:00; EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}- - {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}10.

If they fight, they are more exposed, though, and as a result more people believe that what I say is the truth.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}As a Christian, I don't have a choice. My conscience does not allow me to take part in the evil schemes of this world. So harassing me does not have the effect of making me turn to the world, for God protects me that I won't. It only gives me more, more or less unbelievable experiences to be shared, and more motivation to share them since I get to realize myself, more of the all-pervasiveness of the satanic world system (Bible: "kosmos"(gk),"world"(engl)).{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I empathize with Count Helmuth von Moltke.
