Besides, they hold value elsewhere which they can always sell for whatever the currency will be.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Forgetting the madness of speculative greed, and just concentrating on those who believe that Bitcoin can one day be the reserve world currency/money-- do you believe that such a disproportion in future wealth is something that's going to be good for humanity?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I always thought that one of the ideas behind Bitcoin would be to somehow 'stick it' to the rich/banks/governments. However, if the best case scenario (or one of them) becomes a reality, the thought of the future disparity makes my stomach turn. As it stands, 1/7000th of the world population already owns 50-60% of the total sum of the future 'money', and most of them are hording.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The possibility of this outcome alone makes Bitcoin the ultimate divider of people and predestines it for failure. The failure can, and most likely will, see it become what it once was-- a niche for a specific type of transaction or completely disappearing, or it will be a failure of humanity on an epic scale.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

In fact, some altcoins with superior features could take over most of the cryptocurrency market in as soon as a year or two. Things move fast, and we're still in the early phases of the rise of cryptocurrency. Ordinary people probably still have plenty of time to get into these investments and grow their wealth.

It's not because of bitcoin, it's because of automation, robotics and AI replacing the need for most human labor.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}If you care about someone, plead with them to buy these rapidly growing store-of-value assets such as cryptocurrencies. Many people are going to have to live off of their investments when most jobs will be eliminated in the next few decades. Cryptocurrencies may in fact be the last chance for middle class people to gain enough wealth so that they can survive when automation really starts destroying the job market by making most jobs unnecessary.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Of course, what I'm describing could also cause a collapse of the current economic system. But who knows what would replace it. Things could get tragic for people with no savings or assets to fall back on, during a global depression.

antoineph	181	December 07, 2013, 04:56:56 AM	Bitcoin will never stand on its own. There can and will be many other competing cryptocurrencies. In any one cryptocurrency there can be a small number of large owners. However across many cryptocurrencies the value is much more spread out.

Bitcoin as a niche financial instrument is useful for making money transfers between people and businesses in different countries, to avoid bank wire transfer fees, Western Union fees, PayPal fees, etc. Most of the people and businesses who could save money by using bitcoin for this purpose aren't even using it yet.

The problem is, in a free market economy, wealth naturally accumulates in fewer and fewer hands. Eventually, the poor overthrow the rich through a violent revolution. Then some of the poor revolutionaries become tyrants, as you pointed out. The cycle repeats.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I don't know if there is any permanent escape from this cycle.

Because I certainly don't think the economy is going to be improving anytime soon. All around the world, there is chronic structural unemployment, governments deep in debt and in some cases practically owned by for-profit banks, and a lack of money velocity in the economy because more and more money is being concentrated in the hands of a few people who have so much that they don't need to spend it.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The only people who are truly free are those who have enough assets to live off of their wealth (passive income) rather than needing traditional employment. Cryptocurrencies offer ordinary people a chance to reach that level as this technology explodes over the next few years. I suggest that anyone who can do so, take that chance while it still exists.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}P.S. I certainly hope that people who become wealthy from investing in bitcoin will share their newfound wealth with needy people and worthy causes. It would be great to see more philanthropy by bitcoiners.

With that said, I think your position can be questioned. You say that this is a chance for ordinary people to get a fairer share, but if self-limited cryptos are the way of the future, then aren't a very small amount of early adopters and/or the ones with enough money to invest, going to always form a very small and highly disproportionate amount of wealth holders-- as is already the case today?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Like I said, a tiny amount of the population already holds over half the total amount of Bitcoin. I'm pretty sure the disproportion in other alt-currencies is even more pronounced because they are even less known. And if the amount of potential new currencies is unlimited, then wouldn't it make their very reason for existence pointless?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

It would have to be a project in which developers would work together with philosophical, socially conscious type of people to achieve a common goal of a "people's currency" that spreads wealth around rather than concentrating it.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}My honest opinion is that bitcoin itself is going to become the cryptocurrency for the financial establishment. It's already starting to be embraced by hedge funds, and sooner or later it will be traded as an ETF on the stock market, and within a few years it will be playing a store-of-value role similar to gold in billion-dollar investment portfolios.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I will continue to own bitcoin, because it's a good way to make money and it's a useful tool for sending money abroad without incurring large fees.

They just need to be made aware of it, and they need to be persuaded that it's worth the risk.

It would have to be a project in which developers would work together with philosophical, socially conscious type of people to achieve a common goal of a "people's currency" that spreads wealth around rather than concentrating it.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}My honest opinion is that bitcoin itself is going to become the cryptocurrency for the financial establishment. It's already starting to be embraced by hedge funds, and sooner or later it will be traded as an ETF on the stock market, and within a few years it will be playing a store-of-value role similar to gold in billion-dollar investment portfolios.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I will continue to own bitcoin, because it's a good way to make money and it's a useful tool for sending money abroad without incurring large fees. But I don't believe it's going to fundamentally transfer power to the common folks or anything like that.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quote from: bitbeg on December 07, 2013, 05:48:13 AMYou say anyone should take the chance, but my point is that not just anyone can take the chance, nor will they.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}True. But that, alas, may be part of the human condition. The smart and the lucky have advantages. It is what it is.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quote from: bitbeg on December 07, 2013, 05:48:13 AMI appreciate you actually engaging in a discussion. With that said, I think your position can be questioned. You say that this is a chance for ordinary people to get a fairer share, but if self-limited cryptos are the way of the future, then aren't a very small amount of early adopters and/or the ones with enough money to invest, going to always form a very small and highly disproportionate amount of wealth holders-- as is already the case today?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}There is nothing actually stopping ordinary people from buying bitcoin. They just need to be made aware of it, and they need to be persuaded that it's worth the risk. Even somebody who buys a few hundred bucks worth of it today, could still make thousands of dollars from it within a few years.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The smart would look at this as nothing more than a speculative bubble-- everything about it is a classic bubble. If they are smart, they will probably stay away. There is a difference between smart and informed. So the informed might say this isn't a bubble at all, but they will have an extremely hard time justifying that to someone who is rightfully skeptical and using their smarts.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The ordinary might only need to be made aware, but since they're already relatively late to the game, their success will depend on the people that come after them. If there are none, they will fail. The people that got in early, or have already cashed out are the only winners so far. Time will tell if anyone buying in now will profit, but the fact remains that they will drive the price up most for those who got in early. So the later they get on board the less of a potential payout exists, not only because they're late to the party, but because the more people that buy in, the less potential there is for every new 'investor'. That will make it harder to get any ordinary, smart, or even extraordinary folks to buy in.

It has for most of its history been used for 'off the books' transactions. These transactions were often made to purchase illegal goods. Sure more people are adopting it, but mostly they are doing so to profit somehow from the Bitcoin phenomenon, not because of some profound philosophy or practical future implications. And whatever the tiny % of businesses that have adopted it is, they do not justify the attributed 'value' of any cryptocurrency, because nothing justifies a pricetag (based on fiat, btw) on what is supposed to be a method of exchange. The pricetag is nothing more than speculation.

People who are buying bitcoin are betting that the innovation of cryptocurrency is going to catch on and be used much more widely.

If you planned to go to the pub and buy a pint of beer, you could buy bitcoins for the corresponding amount. It is your choice. If you do, you might be able to buy a hundred pints later. Maybe. Anyway, even the very last adoptor of bitcoin will be able to reap the benefits. It is a money designed to not loose value, forchrissake. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Bitcoin is sound money. In a world with sound money, everybody will win. Some will be richer than the others, but so what? In case of no government intervention, the riches of any individual will depend only of his merit. If one individual is good at making money, it means prosperity to everyone, not only to the one earning the extra profits.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}A prosperous societey means individual rights, private property AND the general understanding that being rich, not by being friend of the government types, but by the merit of making useful products or services for the consumer, is respectable and deserved.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}This was the situation during the industrial revoulution in England. If there is a country or area that have this attitude towards the makers of wealth now, tell me, and I will move there.
