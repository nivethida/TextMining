Xmufa23X	56	April 02, 2012, 01:58:16 AM	Before I start, I would like to clearly state that I know nothing about Economics.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Alright so with April 20th coming up (420), I assume business on the Silk Road is going to be a little more then usual. So I'd imagine that soon people are going to be buying up some BTC and get their 420 orders in. Just guessing here. So with that said, will this drive the value of the Bitcoin up/down in the coming weeks? I am a miner, so should I start saving up my bitcoins, and sell them in a few weeks? Or do you think 4/20/12 will even have an effect on the Bitcoin?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Thoughts?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}EDIT: Fixed typos
teflone	770	April 02, 2012, 02:07:19 AM	I still am very skeptical how much influance SR has..{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I would be impressed if ANYTHING happens around that time.. 2 days either side..; 18th to 22nd..{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}But ..; In my eyes it would go up first, no ?
adamstgBit	1904	April 02, 2012, 02:10:54 AM	Sell us your fucking bitcoins now! {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}just kidding ;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}420 is a very small variable in a very large equation.{ChangeLine}in any case 420 or not, up we go!{ChangeLine}8$ any day now ;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

Mostly I think it will have little effect since sellers would be cashing out their coins/ having their orders hedged, which means the money would pretty much be in and out of btc, netting little effect. Though if it does have an effect I would think it would be pushing it up, some of the people buying on silk road may start using btc for other online stuff as well.

Hard to know the direct economic impact of SR, but the publicity from it has been tremendous.
realnowhereman	504	April 02, 2012, 08:53:46 AM	I don't want to predict either way. However, do bear this in mind:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Every buyer needs a seller.; For there to be a price boost from an SR boost would need a lot of buyers who currently have dollars and a lot of sellers who will keep bitcoins instead of trading back to dollars.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Otherwise it's just: buyer buys bitcoins with dollars -> btc price rises slightly -> seller accepts btc for drugs -> seller sells btc for dollars -> btc price falls slightly.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

OgNasty	2506	April 10, 2012, 05:11:21 AM	I don't think April 20th has the same effect that December 31st has, but I don't doubt there will be increased buying pressure.; Just wait until the block reward halves right before New Year's Eve this year.

finway	714	April 12, 2012, 09:27:37 AM	Didn't noticed that, thanks to your post.
organofcorti	2058	April 12, 2012, 09:35:39 AM	I vote no. Nothing much happened last time there was going to be massive trading on SR.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=62365.0
