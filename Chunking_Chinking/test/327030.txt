SheHadMANHands	1050	November 07, 2013, 02:30:52 PM	They're basically pumping the price up, which, at the same time, guarantees more media attention and more New interest in Bitcoin.; {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Pretty genius, really.

The more they buy, the higher the price goes which limits how much they can buy.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Imagine a new BIT being started in 2016, 10K coins by then might be out of reach even for wall street money.

To those that got in in 2011 I'm sure 10K coins is no big deal.

My realistic outlook, while also being very optimistic, is still far lower than that as well. But it's the premise of replacing M0 I find extremely unlikely. I'm just saying that if we take that premise as a given, I believe a few trillions of precios metals market share, other inflation protection investments and definitely some trillions of the broader money supplies are a given as well. So I would put the upper limit of that scenario a bit higher than you did, unlikely as the scenario may be.

And if SecondMarket were to genuinely have any funds stolen, I doubt the investors would take to much comfort from hearing that any remaining assets can't cover the liabilities, which with the design and exchange rate trajectory of Bitcoin, would definitely be tough. There would literally be no recourse, at least not until "Coin Covenant" protections could or suchlike preventative measures can be taken.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I don't think these trust investors appreciate the risks of failing to understand the risks that they're paying the trusts to understand on their behalf! There are just too many assumptions about making Bitcoin work like any other asset class, and if I were a big fish financial insider with a lot to loose from the Bitcoin "problem", there's a big potential to combine a bit of public loss of confidence with personal control of the BTC supply.

In time I am sure an entire set of best practices for running and auditing a Bitcoin trust will emerge.
