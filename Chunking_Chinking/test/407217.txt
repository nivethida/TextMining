piramida	1120	January 09, 2014, 05:31:27 PM	ghash reaches 45% -> sane miners move elsewhere -> percent drops to 30.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}of course, as long as people who skipped math in school continue to buy cex.io shares, the percentage would be high, but the power of the other (sane) part of the community is greater.
Dafar	1330	January 09, 2014, 05:31:53 PM	It's at 40% (https://blockchain.info/pools?timespan=24hrs) but yeah, kind of... why can't they be like BTC Guild and increase fess to something ridiculous like 40-50% to get miners to join other pools. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I'm not familiar with the mining side of bitcoin and what the implications are, but it's a little disappointing that one group can already gain 51% so early and quickly... when I heard about the 51% attack I thought that group would need an incredible amount of resource to pull that off which made it very unlikely to happen... but it seems like it is more likely to happen than not. Do miners get benefits for being among the pool in the 51%+ group?

BurtW	2198	January 09, 2014, 05:42:39 PM	One pool of miners with a majority of the hashing power is not the same thing as one malicious entity that wants to harm/kill/double spend Bitcoins with a majority of the hashing.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}So, relax.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I have been here for years. ;The same "OMG the sky is falling" threads happened when DeepBit attained a majority of the hashing. ;Where is DeepBit now? ;Where is Bitcoin now?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}So, relax.

Do miners get benefits for being among the pool in the 51%+ group?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}i wouldn't call 5 years in "early", and it has nearly happened before. the main problem is that miners currently (and probably forever) are incentivised to join pools for a more reliable mining income, which is simply one tendency towards centralisation, similar to the tendency towards centralised exchanges (goxopoly) in the earlier years. however, i'm confident that the community as it stands today is both knowledgeable and active enough to avoid the possible crisis scenarios by leaving the pool if you are involved, monitoring the blockchain for suspicious transactions, and promoting awareness through various well-trafficked outlets like /r/bitcoin and these forums. we've shown incredible decentralised cooperation in the past and the entire story of the bitcoin project continues to amaze me as a proof of concept of how dishonest or irresponsible actors can be neutralised in decentralised systems far better than in the centralised ones to which we are accustomed.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}--arepo{ChangeLine}
traderCJ	280	January 09, 2014, 07:51:42 PM	If Bitcoin is going to be the currency of the future, it's going to take more than reassurances from mining pools that they'll act responsibly.; It's going to take more than people screaming on reddit to switch pools or else "teh sky will fal".; It'll take more than CEX lamely claiming they did not condone a double spend attack originating from their pool.; A protocol which secures billions of dollars of wealth (and potentially trillions) must enforce good behavior from consumers all the way to the miners.; This currency cannot assume that actors 1) will act in their own best interest and 2) have interests that are aligned with Bitcoin's success.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It's different this time (tm).; It doesn't matter if pools have exceeded 51% in the past with no ill effect.; We're talking $12 billion at stake here.; We're talking about a currency poised to replace the banking sector, sans regulatory interference.; We're talking about a technology that can replace credit cards.; To rely on the good behavior of market participants in ludicrous.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Bitcoin was the first of its kind.; A prototype, perhaps never intended for mass acceptance in its current form.; If we're going to make this prototype the gold standard of crypto-currencies, it's going to take more than name recognition + a shitload of miners with tremendous amounts of sunk capital cranking away if the code base itself is lacking in necessary features.; Bitcoin is at risk of becoming that stereotypical gigantic corporation, easily outflanked by the smaller, nimbler competition.; I hope I am wrong.
Notanon	390	January 09, 2014, 08:08:57 PM	They did mention an option they're planning to implement to allow for mining hardware to be directed to other pools. Might use that to finish up mining with Slush's pool and then either go back to them or point them at something else like a Peercoin mining pool instead.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Let's face it, CEX.io and Cloudhashing.com have made mining a bit more accessible for those who don't want to jump through all the hoops of buying and setting up ASICs and FPGAs and end up worrying about software crashes or power consumption.

BitcoinBarrel	1246	January 10, 2014, 04:06:00 PM	Since they're already getting close to 51% (let's face it 45% is pretty dang close), I would like to see them implement the feature of choosing your pool.

During peak periods, Bitcoin has hit its 7 transactions per second limit. If Bitcoin transaction volume continues to grow, it's going to hit that limit regularly. The block size and transaction rate limit cannot be increased unless ghash.io wants it increased. All they have to do is refuse to confirm blocks beyond the current 250KB limit. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Whenever the block chain has a big backlog of unconfirmed transactions, ghash.io is in charge of Bitcoin. They have the power now to effectively impose higher transaction fees, or favor some transactions over others. For example, Coinbase could cut a deal with ghash.io for "express transaction confirmation" - their transactions get processed first. That would be a win for Coinbase - their merchant shopping cart service needs fast confirmations. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The next big issue for Bitcoin may be "net neutrality". {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Or even more damaging, an exclusive express transaction confirmation: "We ghash promise that no competitor of yours will be able to process quickly."

If you want to hit one block, you need 0.025% of the network hashrate. This is about 3750 Gh/s. 30GH/s cost about 1000$, so you need about 100 000$ of equipment. {ChangeLine}-> it's possible, but unlikely. Maybe this are some private pools. 10 people invest each 10 grand and mine together.
