Only one entry per person and no edits to your post except within the forum defined 10 minutes{ChangeLine}3. In the case of two identical predictions the first posted will be accepted.{ChangeLine}4. Predictions after 17th 06:00:00 are invalid.{ChangeLine}5. All times are gmt.{ChangeLine}6. Predictions to have 4 decimal places{ChangeLine}7. In the case of two predictions one higher, one lower but equidistant from the low the lower will be the winner.{ChangeLine}8. There's a good chance I've missed some flaw in this. If that is the case I'm going to make a judgement call and apologise in advance.{ChangeLine}9. No matter what someone will be sent 0.1 btc on monday.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Post your guess then on the next line your bitcoin address. You can chat in this thread but to enter the comp you need a post with nothing but you guess followed by your address.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}e.g.{ChangeLine}Quote382.0000{ChangeLine}1L3k39JdMufhbeX1fxGf5oiN72ieoZM6Gj{ChangeLine}NOT{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quoteoh hai i have a few questions but i guess around 500 and my address is 1L3k39JdMufhbeX1fxGf5oiN72ieoZM6Gj plus do you know where i can get litecoin.{ChangeLine}Have fun.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

Probably if I did it again I'd allow edits up until that point but it makes it a real hassle to check. This way if I see a post has been edited I can dismiss it pretty easily.
