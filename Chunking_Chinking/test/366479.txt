MAbtc	672	December 11, 2013, 01:03:34 AM	I hope you're right. I'm almost out of coins to sell. Did well on the drop to 576, expected a top in the 900s...... 
exstasie	770	December 11, 2013, 01:13:33 AM	i dunno..it could remain stagnant for a while.; But based on how its been, it looks like you might be correct!
Xer0	840	December 11, 2013, 01:15:40 AM	it will crash again but nobody will be able to see it coming!

You think we land considerably higher than the 576 bottom?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}To me, I was looking at the previous two 'bubbles' and 'crashes' - first was from $1-$32 then back to $2, followed by a long period of fairly stagnant price. Next was $32-$266 and down to $50 low, settling at around $100 for 6 months or so. I often hear people suggesting that as growth continues, the price swings ought to become smaller, as will the time for which price settles after making a big movement. This seems to make sense to me, so I was expecting something like a 50% drop from the peak of this last rally (which is more or less what we saw), followed by price settling somewhere lower than the peak but higher than the bottom of the dip, and for a period of less than 6 months. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}If we settle around $700 for 2-3 months without going below $576, I will be pretty confident that we'll see another big rally taking us past $1200, maybe to the next order of magnitude ($10 000+){ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}(I know, past performance, future results etc. - there is no way to predict the future)

At times, the price is stagnant. It is not moving upward like it was before the most recent drop. It seems people are less confident buying at these prices as they were heretofore the drop. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Not sure, but I suspect it will either drop or go up.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I know, you can't go wrong with such a statement. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}In all truth, though, part of me thinks bitcoin will not drop again without some negative press. I fear bitcoin is very susceptible to a collapse if news out of the EU severely limits bitcoin, which can put a heavy strain on Bitstamp and BTC-e. If those two exchangers are hurt via political or economic legislation by the EU, Bitcoin will drop under $100.00 and will sink like the Titanic.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Bitcoin will not die and will rise again. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}These are birth pangs. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Remember, you cannot rise to the top without stepping on a few toes. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}
