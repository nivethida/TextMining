proudhon	1274	April 15, 2012, 04:12:02 AM	I predict that a year from now the bitcoin price will be in the single digits.; I just want to enshrine this prediction in its own thread.; I hope somebody remembers to dig this up a year from now.; In the meantime I hope to take advantage of the next bitcoin bubble.; My the odds be ever in my favor.
bb113	728	April 15, 2012, 05:24:02 AM	;You're right. Up to 15 or so then back down to 5 one year from now.
GoWest	552	April 15, 2012, 05:25:34 AM	Crazy speculators.; One year from now, Bitcoin will be trading for $13.95, give or take a penny.
bb113	728	April 15, 2012, 05:47:00 AM	Its all self fullfillinginging,
S3052	2100	April 15, 2012, 09:17:00 AM	it is difficult to predict timings, but in terms of price, I predict bitcoin will have exceeded 32 $ within the next 12 months.

YoYa	760	April 15, 2012, 10:29:40 AM	Next year we'll be too busy killing Aztec Zombies to care about Bitcoin. Only after the survivors have consolidated in a city state and retaken the earth will people consider currency again, but due to depopulation they'll be too rich to give a flying fuck and will instead spend their time crashing dead peoples Ferraris and helicopters leading to the second endangered Human species crisis.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}
ElectricMucus	1610	April 15, 2012, 12:17:15 PM	At current prices bitcoin is valued at 105 mio USD. That is 963 tesla roadsters.{ChangeLine}They sold roughly 2100 of them from 2008 to 2010. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}So bitcoin currently is valued at the yearly budget of a fairly large company. Right now it produces alpaca socks and ships drugs. (Dramatized){ChangeLine}The point of this? {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Don't expect significant rise in value.
naima53	616	April 15, 2012, 12:49:41 PM	I hear a lot about "acceptance bitcoin." But I think it has already taken place. I think the price will vary throughout the year. In the range of $ 3 ...; 8 (if it will not "blast" advertising and "Google has invested in the project") Here's my prediction. The best way for the development (successful) of the project.

dopamine	486	April 15, 2012, 06:03:07 PM	Double digit for sure when you start to see alot more places accepting bitcoins, I don't mind the single digit so I can accumulate alot more and be part of the 1%, If I can easily pay all my bills using my bitcoins then I can say that bitcoins will be worth over 20. So developers make me a debit card that will do that and let the rally begin 
Technomage	1890	April 15, 2012, 06:24:26 PM	Double digits for sure. I'll guess $16.

I know diablo3 will play a key role in bringing bitcoin to gamers (because in hardcore mode their will not be an auction house for real money). come Xmas time, buy gifts using bitcoin. If you smoke then considered saving money by buying European cigarettes for bitcoin.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Positive brings Positive. {ChangeLine}Stop thinking what bitcoin can do for you, instead think what you can do for bitcion. ;

If nothing weird happens it will go up I think {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I just posted about this in another thread, but I'll post it here too. ;The problem is if the price doesn't immediately and sufficiently go up after the block reward halving. ;If it does not, then less efficient miners' profits will be immediately cut in half, making many of them unprofitable. ;This will probably compel lots of miners in that category to finally drop out. ;This will leave only the more efficient miners - e.g. FPGA miners - as they can tolerate such a production increase as their operating costs are much less. ;The remaining efficient miners toleration of reduced profits could lead to competition for those profits, effectively decreasing the price.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I think there's a good chance the price does not immediately and sufficiently go up after the block reward halving because I think there's a good chance people will attempt to price a potential price increase in ahead of time, and if enough people with enough market influence price it in ahead of time, it won't happen at the time.
Technomage	1890	April 18, 2012, 12:54:45 PM	The most important thing to understand about future mining is that it's not a bad thing that most GPU miners need to quit. Only those with fixed electricity costs or added benefits (such as heating) will be able to continue. FPGA is the future but that is not a bad thing. FPGA's are great, GPU mining sucks ass compared to that. I've done some mining and I speak from experience that GPU rigs are a fucking pain in the ass. It's absolutely wonderful that we have FPGA's, they are so convenient that at least convenience will not be slowing down mining investments (which it certainly does, to an extent, with GPU mining).{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}We are already well beyond the times when mining is having a gpu on your desktop PC and you just mine with it. More and more mining is done by either semi-professional multirig operations (1-20 rigs) or big time mining operations (hundreds of rigs). This is the natural development of mining and there is nothing wrong with it. Regular people will buy bitcoins, not mine them. Mining is for those who see it either as a business or a hobby or something in between (which is an increasing portion of miners). 
ElectricMucus	1610	April 18, 2012, 01:39:11 PM	The problem with FPGAs is the recent trend to proprietary products. That is something which I would call antisocial greed. They have no interest in bitcoin and are only selling products for fiat. This forces existing miner who wanna upgrade to sell their old equipment for fiat which would otherwise flow back into the bitcoin economy.{ChangeLine}But the longer trend gives hope, since the Spartan 6 LX150 has been established as 'the chip' for open source mining platforms it will get synergistic improvement from various projects and possible market leverage in buying the chips in the future.{ChangeLine}This will strengthen the community and provide stable growth if people realize they will be better up with open products with community involvement and room to improvement than proprietary crap.

But honestly, it was'nt really such a great business model. The risks are just too great. And what ARE you gonna do with FPGAs if "shit starts hitting the fan"? Just wishing your lost investment away won't do the trick. Unless you are in denial. This may be a wide spread issue around Bitcoin entrepreneurs.

FPGAs can easily be used for other purposes and their resell value will not be anywhere near 0, regardless of what happens with Bitcoin. There's plenty of hobbyists playing with FPGAs for all kinds of purposes and especially a medium sized cluster of them is a rather attractive piece of equipment.{ChangeLine}With ASICs on the other hand you have the high risk of losing all your investment should Bitcoin have to upgrade its hashing routines due to advances in cryptoanalysis. I'd be wary to bet a million on SHA256 staying secure enough for another decade and that's exactly what ASIC early adopters would be doing.

If Asics do show up try to find a hobbiest to take your then unprofitable mini rig. Esp. if there are thousands of users to offer fpgas to them suddenly. But those people who made profits with their GPUs are likely to take that risk. The Asic guys must be close to crazy imo for investing so much cash into something so fundamentally risky. In fact, so risky that I'd hold them to be bad businessmen to take the risks. That's probably why they want the community to cover their risk in offering shares. Now, factor in greed, and it's probably gonna happen anyway. The question remains if and which of those risks may come true and who will lose in the end. Again, if I want to go gambling, I choose a Casino. I don't think this has anything to do with real business and acceptable risk.

Tomatocage	1540	March 06, 2013, 05:05:57 PM	The year+ predictions are the only ones worth speculating on.; I mean when BTC is at $49 and you start a thread "predicting" that it will hit $50 within the week, that's pretty lame.

Honestly, I've used proudhons predictions as what 'not' to do.{ChangeLine}Honestly, I don't think proudhon believes his/her own predictions either. If I was sitting on a mountain of btc and I wanted to keep it circulating without spending my own coins I would try to convince people to quickly sell theirs.{ChangeLine}Or he/she has terrible foresight, in proudhons defense, no one could have predicted the recent boom in btc

serenitys	126	April 04, 2014, 12:15:58 AM	Since I just posted this on another thread:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}ou probably won\x92t see widespread adoption of Eaze soon but it\x92s an interesting mobile payment system that ties Google Glass with BitCoin. Using the app and a QR code for transactions, you simply nod twice to make a payment{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}http://gigaom.com/2014/02/26/hands-free-bitcoin-payments-with-google-glass-and-eaze-just-nod-twice/{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Google Glass launch - late 2014{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/features/gadget/3436249/google-glass-release-date-price-specs/{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I predict the value is beyond 4 digits this time 2015. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Read this very carefully before you go all "single digits" and pennies:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}So how does Eaze work? The client app runs on Google Glass and can read QR codes that have transactional information at the point of sale. Glass shows the details of the payment on its viewscreen and you simply nod twice to approve the transaction with payment made in BitCoins. Eaze users will have to deposit BitCoins in what the company calls a \x94deterministic wallet\x94 which is unlocked with a passphrase locally. In this way, the BitCoins are never stored on the Eaze servers.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}So...if that's happening later this year and GG users have to use Bitcoin, and a shit ton of people are waiting on GG, they're inevitably going to be buying BTC for use, which drives the value{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Wait for it... {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}to da moon bitches ;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}In all seriousness, toward the summer when Google starts hyping up Glass for release, more people will be encountering "bitcoin" and having to bone up, and will start a buying run. Glass isn't going to fail...and there's also Rift and games for it to consider, who are also accepting btc. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Mid summer this year should kick up the hype and push it through the end of the year and into 2015...no way btc will be in double digits...if it jumped to 4 digits for lesser reasons, it should shoot well beyond that for the launch of a Google backed product that is being greatly anticipated.
