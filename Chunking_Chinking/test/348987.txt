CalibrataBG	38	November 27, 2013, 03:15:07 PM	I got only 1 bitcoin left, so 1 mil would be nice ... millionaire with only 1 coin would make me happy
Money Raccoon	67	November 27, 2013, 03:16:06 PM	Soon there'll be a 'so how do you feel for selling at $1000 thread'
BitcoinBarrel	1246	November 27, 2013, 03:17:51 PM	It took so long to reach $1000 are you sure you want it to go away now?

porcupine87	546	November 27, 2013, 04:14:59 PM	Bitstamp is not tired of 1000$. There you have 7.2 Mio. $ resistence to 1000$ - increasing. The last time I looked it was 6.5Mio. The market is a promising market
PenAndPaper	252	November 27, 2013, 04:21:43 PM	Stop being greedy! It's bad karma; 
BitChick	1134	November 27, 2013, 04:22:21 PM	Funny. ; {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Seriously though, I hope the fact we got to $1000 lights a fire under some people that have not been taking Bitcoin seriously and they decide they need to buy now in a promising market. ;We might just skim past $1000. We are definitely in a increasing market ;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Bitcoin is a little unpredictable though.
Hyena	1932	November 27, 2013, 04:22:31 PM	Will we ever see $1000 again?
GriTBitS	336	November 27, 2013, 05:32:55 PM	Do you think its a bubble? Should I wait for it to go back down to 10$ like it was last year to buy in. Some top economists say its risky and I should wait for it to level off probably around a million before I buy in. Don't know what to do. I would hate to buy and wake up and it trading at 1040$ after buying at 1045. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}
Carlton Banks	1946	November 27, 2013, 06:06:21 PM	Hard lols{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The real joke is that this joke will start to become more like the truth than it is a joke. I remember in the growing market there was a nail-biter, but now a $50 drop is like a drop in the bucket.
Trade101	126	November 29, 2013, 02:35:37 PM	the current price/BTC is quite high for a currency that most people only hoard, with very little spending going on :-) 
stash	172	November 29, 2013, 04:48:20 PM	LOL.We are in the best market now. Keep on.
