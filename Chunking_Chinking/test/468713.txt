marvinrouge	378	February 16, 2014, 07:24:41 AM	How is it possible to dump less than the half of the price of the other exchanges ? Anyway the cash is trapped too ;{ChangeLine}Who throw away thousands of coin ?{ChangeLine}Any thoughts ? ;
catcow	68	February 16, 2014, 07:26:41 AM	it does not make any sense. i'm worried something very bad is going on, but i have no idea what.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}dumping because gox is insolvent does you no good, so i don't think that is the cause of this.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}(i also think gox is solvent)
odolvlobo	2072	February 16, 2014, 07:29:13 AM	My guess is that people with BTC on Mt. Gox now believe that they are more likely to be able to withdraw dollars than BTC. I think that the belief is that some amount of BTC is missing and the dollars can be audited and recovered if Mt. Gox closes, and the BTC can't. I don't know if any of that is true. It is just an educated guess.
thelema93	280	February 16, 2014, 07:31:14 AM	presumably because Gox has temporarily halted BTC withdrawals, a whole bunch of paranoids are selling their coins so they can withdraw the fiat instead. A panic sell off of BTC = massive price drop on Gox. I don't think there's anything more sinister than that going on - unless you can prove it?
dropt	1498	February 16, 2014, 07:32:37 AM	It was me.; Sorry guys, clicked the wrong button.
fonzie	504	February 16, 2014, 07:32:55 AM	@thelema 93 u have been preachin "everything is alright on MtGox for days".. Won\xb4t you ever feel stupid or at least stop it?
JCviggen	546	February 16, 2014, 07:36:10 AM	While just an unlikely conspiracy theory, it could help a fiat strapped Mt.Gox to have everyone buy BTC and then move it off the exchange once withdrawals are enabled.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}At this point I'm not sure what is going on, except that there has to be some agenda under the surface. It makes no sense for huge BTC holders to do anything but sit back and pray withdrawals are soon re-enabled. Dumping 60% below the average price elsewhere makes no sense unless they know something we don't. Nothing released so far suggests to me that the odds of Gox going down are 60%.

GeniuSxBoY	616	February 16, 2014, 09:00:33 AM	If this is what it takes to get solvent again, then I'm for it. I'm not playing with fire and selling because I know that when I do, Gox will announce that they are trading again 
TaaviK	26	February 16, 2014, 09:35:22 AM	Everyone who had fiat on Gox and was tempted to buy bitcoins has already bought them. I believe there are very few people left who have fiat on Gox that they sold quite higher and are hoping for it to still go lower to buy in.{ChangeLine}What the whale is doing is giving the appearance that the coins really are this cheap on Gox while in reality they are actually not because there is almost noone left to buy them. There are however HODLERS and gullible speculators who are panicing and are induced into selling their coins thinking the price will go even lower. The lower the price goes the bigger the chance that these people will finally sell their coins. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}What is actually going on as mentioned many times before is that the whale is selling coins to his own walls and hoping weak hands will panic and sell theirs aswell. He has done it a few times already in the last few days. It started with selling pressure of 20-50 btc batches being sold every 7-10min. This went on for ~24-36h nonstop and then he increased it to 100-300 btc bathes sold every 3-4min because at one point there were people who had fiat on Gox who wanted to buy cheap bitcoins and were creating buying pressure. So the whale compensated and made the situation look even more bleak. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I thought 300 would be the bottom since Gox is probably close to fixing the withdrawals and the whale probably milked people enough these last few days but actually what we are seeing is that the whale is interested in making money and has zero morals to go with it. He is going to milk this community till the very last moment before withdrawals to get as much as possible regardless of the damage to other people or to bitcoin. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}If the whale can squeeze in another cycle of this constant selling pressure followed by his walls trying to push the price up again then he will do it. It will probably not happen since a) MtGox will probably fix the withdrawal situation on monday and b) when the banks start working on monday there will be new fiat flying in to buy those cheap coins.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

wbaw	62	February 16, 2014, 09:59:20 AM	I think it's robot wars.

wbaw	62	February 16, 2014, 10:09:19 AM	It's got to be a mad robot, or mark getting really desperate to balance the books somehow (but i can't see that, he could just sell on other exchanges), nobody is really selling btc at $270. I'd loan money to buy if anybody wants to sell me some btc for that, but i don't think i'll get many offers.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Nobody is panicking & the off exchange prices are going up for goxbtc.
marvinrouge	378	February 16, 2014, 10:16:51 AM	With all transfers blocked it the good time for manipulating the price.{ChangeLine}For ex. creating an artificial new low.{ChangeLine}Anyway everyone are waiting for the bottom to buy, maybe the best way to be sure to catch the bottom is to create it... Even if he loose money today he's sure the market will bounce once the withdrawal restored...
wbaw	62	February 16, 2014, 10:17:40 AM	I think it's somebody with a bot that is manipulating another out of control bot to take all it's coins cheap & not enough people can get money in to buy btc to stop it, they're all already all in goxbtc.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It seemed to be a timed & calculated huge buy that caused a big spike in price that triggered an automatic selloff by messing with the moving averages. It's just some rich but very primitive trading bot that got tricked, or lots of primitive trading bots got tricked.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The gox price wont recover until some fiat deposits are allowed in or fiat withdrawals cancelled.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Somebody is going to be really annoyed when they see what their trading bot did while they weren't looking & somebody is going to be really happy with all the cheap coins they got.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It hasn't had any effect on any other exchanges, yet. Wonder what will happen when gox allow btc withdrawals.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Unless the seller knows some kind of inside information they just lost big.

fluidjax	672	February 16, 2014, 04:26:10 PM	Perhaps these moves are all to reduce liability once (if) declared insolvent, so the BTC price redistributed to holders will be cents on the dollar value of the last traded price when the exchange is declared closed.{ChangeLine}So they sell these worthless BTC to everyone and stash the cash,{ChangeLine}Getting as much $ as possible in effectively the Gox Bank account and reducing the price of BTC close to 0 is the best strategy for them.{ChangeLine}
