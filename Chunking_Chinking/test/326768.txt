zirt	298	November 07, 2013, 06:16:10 AM	I discovered BTC around 160usd{ChangeLine}I never bought. For many reasons. Good and bad reasons.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Main one is I think, sooner or later, I don't know how, BTC will be stopped. No way Visa, Mastercard, Banks become useless.{ChangeLine}Another reason is I have no confidence in exchangers, so can't trade easy.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Anyway, I have to agree, since, BTC went big up. And yes it CAN continue.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Each hours it goes up 0.5 or 1usd... Each time I refresh it went up... a big, steady, up, wow, impressive.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}And it is worst when I think to people that have thousands of BTCs they got for 1 or 10usd... All geeks... {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Well done. Wish you the best! For me really anything can happen, even if bear market of BTCs, I would really shake, value can, for me, be twice, or 0, when I wake up...

superduh	602	November 07, 2013, 08:02:11 AM	sleep is for the non-geeks. people tell me they had good sleep i envy them
phlogistonq	159	November 07, 2013, 08:32:24 AM	I thought you were going to complain about how you stay up all night watching the charts 'day'trading. I have gone through about 4 weeks of about 3 hours a sleep at night, except for an occasional night of catch-up sleep when the rate appeared somewhat stable. Exhausting. And still am feeling I am worried I am going to miss a sudden dramatic event. (like the fork in blockchain earlier this year).{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}This is one thing I hate bigtime about trading BTC, it goes on 24 hrs a day.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The only remedy is buy and hold.

piramida	1120	November 07, 2013, 08:55:30 AM	I only wake up when the value goes up 300%. Last time, I had almost two years of sleep. This time, only 5 month. Next time, what, a bubble per month? Bitcoin is such an attention whore 
mb300sd	1260	November 07, 2013, 09:23:30 AM	10 beers deep. {ChangeLine}Still can't sleep.

Banks and big parts of our global financial structures are already doomed, they just don't know it yet. And no the future doesn't take Visa.
JimboToronto	1764	November 07, 2013, 11:16:55 AM	Sleep? LOL{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I went to bed around 1:00AM (6:00UTC) and woke up about 2.5 hours later with a full bladder and my instinctive Bitcoin alarm wailing frantically, just in time to see 300 smashed.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Still awake.

superresistant	1778	November 07, 2013, 12:29:24 PM	I have so much things to do but what is more important than Bitcoin ?
derekleong75	243	November 07, 2013, 03:23:51 PM	I am lucky to be in Singapore, watching charts all day long at work and feeling psyched up along the climb!
ScrapOfCat	197	November 07, 2013, 06:54:25 PM	Six hours acquired, clown crisis averted. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Bring it bear market on bitcoin, I can do 24 in a row!

No way Visa, Mastercard, Banks become useless.{ChangeLine}This is the difference between those who will become rich from Bitcoin, and the rest of bear market out there, like yourself.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Its just a different brain process I'm afraid. ;You don't have the viewpoint necessary to understand it.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Here's some insight into the other type of thinking: ;Ask yourself: ;How many merchants out there will continue to willingly give 3-12% of their sales to Visa and Mastercard when there is an option out there which is offering a 0%-1% option? ; I am a small merchant and I get anally raped to the tune of $4,500 a month in merchant fees alone. ;The percentage can reach 12% on a transaction if the user is outside the USA and using a rewards credit card. This doesn't take crazy, out of the box thinking. ;Its common sense. ;Visa and Mastercard are done for, if Bitcoin continues. ;Amazon.com alone will save something like 40 million dollars a month in merchant fees. ;Ya think they'd be up for that option? ; I do ...{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}You lack the confidence (and possibly the understanding) to take the necessary risk.; {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}-Burger-

byronbb	1414	November 08, 2013, 01:07:22 AM	Ya you are a noob, after a while you learn bitcoin is a yo-yo and worrying about the price all the time is torture.
