mmitech	1106	December 18, 2013, 07:26:41 PM	so in wikipedia there is an article for the chart look of a classic bubble stage, it is from Jean-Paul Rodrigue source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Rodrigue{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I hate to admit that as much as I hate watching the "stage of a bubble chart", it seems so F%&$/!? accurate, Is Bitcoin a different story ?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}from bitcoinwisdon 1d zoom out{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Looks familiar ?

Gabi	1134	December 18, 2013, 07:48:18 PM	This is what, the fifth bubble bitcoin had? Boring.

mapsi	47	December 18, 2013, 08:47:54 PM	sigh btc isnt your traditional commodity. to try and characterize crypto whould def need an extended chart and much more then a couple years of speculation. This drop is strictly due to China pulling back. To try and say it was foresaw via a chart s ridiculous.; 
RodeoX	2576	December 18, 2013, 08:50:19 PM	If the chart is right we should see a drop to like $150. I think our mean is about $270 right now.

Tzupy	1456	December 18, 2013, 09:16:36 PM	Usually I find that picture misleading, but now it looks uncanny...{ChangeLine}Maybe more important is that the 1d MACD has now turned negative after a long time.
bitleif	351	December 18, 2013, 09:57:59 PM	The graph is actually quite accurate.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Except in EVERY bitcoin bubble so far, the after-bubble price has been much higher than the incoming price.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}In other words, the grey "mean" line at the bottom should be sloping much steeper upwards.

Hunterbunter	994	December 18, 2013, 11:07:51 PM	Yeah it's still such a new market, and more and more people are becoming convinced of bitcoins true, combined with a very small percentage of total coins actually on the market at any one time, mean the "mean" is going to be very hard to penetrate.

trumbadera	113	December 19, 2013, 01:20:14 AM	The fit is nice so far, but shouldnt next data have to be uncertain (otherwise it would be too easy to make pofits by everyone if we know tommorow price)

It clearly shows that Bitcoin is going to drop to below zero values, in the near future. Not only would it be worthless, but people would actually be paying money to get rid of their bitcoins. Maybe I should open a bitcoin disposal service, or something.
evolve	700	December 19, 2013, 01:38:08 AM	yeah, thats exactly what that chart shows;

TERA	574	December 19, 2013, 04:24:58 AM	I think we're still in this "return to normal" phase now because everyone is still following the movements of btcchina while forgetting and denying to themselves that is a sinking ship. Every recovery is led by btcchina still.
GeniuSxBoY	616	December 19, 2013, 04:39:39 AM	Yes, without a doubt it's going to go down again.
nanobrain	994	December 19, 2013, 04:45:10 AM	What goat said.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Every rise/fall/correction this chart gets pulled out... of course it looks accurate but it has no time scale...you can zoom in/out pretty much any stock and get it to fit into this pattern...that's because crowds follow the same patterns, which is essentially Elliot wave theory - when any stock rises suddenly it tends to fall in this pattern.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Just hodl and enjoy your holidays.

klovishey	199	December 19, 2013, 09:43:56 AM	The log chart looks less scary, but I believe the bubble graph typical example is intended for no log scale

WompRat	232	December 19, 2013, 08:38:28 PM	Wow that\x92s some lazy ass journalism.; Even if Bitcoin returns to $100, perhaps they would like to name a fund, stock, asset or anything else that has had a better ROI in the last 12 months.; This may be the start of the end, but it is way too early to make that call yet. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}That\x92s why I personally like the log chart. It better reflects the reality of what is happening.; Even if you bought at $1200 there is an exceedingly good chance that we will be past that in 12 months in my opinion.; I have been trying to find an example of something else that has behaved with so much volatility with spikes, dips and rapid recoveries, but I am not having much luck so far.; {ChangeLine}

nicolaennio	99	December 19, 2013, 09:46:21 PM	What I do not get is that there have been so many times where bitcoins were crashing and this "bubble chart" was not applying and now that we did not even know if we are in the "popping bubble" phase, everyone is quick to fit that chart.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Looks like a sort of investor's fallacy here but of course, if people believe that, they should sell.
