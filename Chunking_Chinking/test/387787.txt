mmitech	1106	December 27, 2013, 09:37:37 PM	watching the price of bitcoin is like watching "how I met your mother", you get pissed because of not knowing the mother but at the same time you do not want to know who is the mother because simply the show will end {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}people want the price to go down to "buy cheap coins" yet they want bitcoin to go up.....; ;I want to shutdown the PC and try to not visit this forum for at least 3 months, but I cant.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}so Bitcoin is not only an economical phenomena, it is a social phenomena where everyone built this communication bridge (this forum) where they can all discuss and work around together....

undeadbitcoiner	504	December 28, 2013, 09:48:59 PM	This is the market, If there will not be such mixed expressions and such up and dowm how market will follow, If such up and downs will not happen then how could we work. By the way Market is now slowly stable so atleast we could believe that price is going up with a hard standups, Its quite interesting.
