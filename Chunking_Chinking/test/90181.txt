casascius	1386	June 27, 2012, 04:00:59 AM	For what it's worth, I have seen a recent increase in the volume of sales of Casascius Coins, yet I haven't done anything recently to prompt it. ;By recent, I mean over the past week, and the average volume is probably double the quantity of orders and many of them are larger than average.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I suppose it could mean anything - maybe there was a posting somewhere that got a lot of attention, or maybe a popular gift-giving day is coming up that I just haven't realized. ;Maybe we've reached a hump of BTC price spurting and people now want to spend some coins. ;Your guess may be as good as or better than mine, I thought I would throw it out there, just for what it's worth.

Hexadecibel	566	June 27, 2012, 04:17:45 AM	I got one for me pa!
SgtSpike	1372	June 27, 2012, 04:25:17 AM	Maybe that libertarian get-together inspired a bunch of them to go out and buy some?

(I understand that you may not wish to, for perfectly valid reasons.)
miscreanity	1288	June 27, 2012, 05:03:50 AM	I ordered recently, partly because I think they're collectible, and partly for the novelty. Have to say, the service was excellent!{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}People have been asking me about Bitcoin recently, so it helps to make an impact when there's a tangible item. Military personnel especially seem to appreciate a real object, and tend to quickly grasp that it's a representation of value.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}They're also great for birthday gifts, tips for cute waitresses (h/t Mike), and as conversation pieces, especially because of the recurring theme of financial panic seemingly without any real solutions. For some people, after discussing the concept, there is an understanding that Bitcoin could be a genuine solution instead of more lip service. I've presented coins at a number of meetups, and always wind up the popular guy after that for some reason. Must be my dashing good looks.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}With that said, I ran out way too quickly. Time to order more...

(I understand that you may not wish to, for perfectly valid reasons.){ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}There are two third-party stats trackers for my coins. ;Their information is based on the fact that I have published in advance a list of all the pre-generated bitcoin addresses for my coins, along with some hints I have given to the authors of those two sites as to how I intend to use them.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}http://casascius.appspot.com{ChangeLine}http://casascius.uberbills.com{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Now, day-to-day activity is hard to see for the following two reasons:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}* for international orders, and for 100,1000 BTC pieces, I fund them after they are received, so block chain transactions happen a couple weeks later{ChangeLine}* for US (and small international) orders, I usually fund a bunch of coins in a batch, and then draw them from a bin... so day-to-day order filling doesn't result in any block chain transactions.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}When I first introduced the coins, it was the Christmas shopping season, and I had a really hard time keeping them in stock, with individual orders of 50+ and 100+ coins being regular. ;Through the months of 5-dollar bitcoins orders were relatively slow, just a few orders a week and almost always small. ;I haven't made marketing Casascius coins a huge priority, for example my website could use some new photos (and some more robust hosting), I presume that if I put more effort into it I'll sell more coins, but simply have other priorities that have kept me from it.

Tril	213	June 27, 2012, 01:54:17 PM	Mike you forgot you placed a big ad in bitcoin magazine for these?; {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Also, this video of buying a Casascius coin from a vending machine is on page 2 of youtube search for "bitcoin" currently at 6300+ views.{ChangeLine}http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2K6nNj_LEE

Serge	1050	June 27, 2012, 03:10:29 PM	consider putting up google analytics on your site, it will provide you with stats about your traffic and where it comes from if you're not using some local web stats tracking software

No-one had a clue (or looked like they cared) what these shiny things were/are, but I told them that they were "worth" about $3 USD. I can't wait to see the faces next Christmas when I tell them what they are worth then (I hope they remember where they put them!).{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Also - great item to have in your pocket just in case some asks you about bitcoin (which frequently happens if you wear a bitcoin t-shirt or use a bitcoin coffee mug at work).{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Thanks Mike!
scribe	295	June 27, 2012, 04:08:52 PM	Curious - seeing some rise in interest here as well: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=90217.0{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I've also literally had my first ever contacts to buy BTC via localbitcoins.com in the last days - 3 in total, 2 within minutes of each other, oddly. Will have to find out where they heard about it from.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}(Don't take this as thread-jacking, just trying to draw a few threads together.)

Such a scam just doesn't make good business sense, it makes far more sense to compete and make legit coins. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I don't see why it's not good business sense (assuming morality isn't a factor).; Something that costs you 5.31 BTC to make, costs the scammer .31 BTC to make.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It's no different from normal counterfeiting of course; people already make fake $20 notes.; The difference here -- and is why I'm raising it -- is that your website supplying a list of valid keys gives the fake coins an air of legitimacy.; It's using your good name to steal from people.{ChangeLine}

The cost of faking them doesn't seem worth it. It would probably be easier to design a prettier coin and compete with casascius than replicating his perfectly.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Even if used for general circulation they seem as safe as most cash.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Even if you faked them you would have to provide a loaded address, which people could check = everything fails when people notice money is moving in and out of that address. (make that SAFER than most cash).

The small disc is placed against the coin (there's a circular impression that makes it easy to do so), and the supplied gold sticker is attached on top of that, forming a covering layer. It works just like the hologram in that you peel the sticker off to gain access to the private key, only you can't see the public address through the sticker.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}You would use the public address to load Bitcoin value before applying the sticker, of course. Then it's a nice piece to give as a gift, although the hologram definitely makes a bigger impact.
Raize	1414	July 01, 2012, 07:27:28 AM	Something I think people are forgetting, and this is obviously in defense of physical Bitcoin, but the vast majority of the people handing you a physical Bitcoin are going to be collectors or people that you KNOW. If you're buying these from people you don't know, you're always going to run the slight risk of being scammed.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}By the time fake hologram coins are used, every coin before that point is still just as secure as it previously was (give or take a few months). That means the time to buy is honestly right now. I have bought from Casascius in the past and recently purchased yet again. I love being able to just show them off and give them to family and friends on the off chance that maybe someday they are worth more than their weight in gold. Call it a pipe dream, but it's definitely a way to impress and intrigue folks you run into.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Plus, I have a couple of the gold-plated 25 BTC coins in my safe for when I die, along with the names of family members that will receive them and the name of another local broker that will accept them. The more Bitcoin grows the more valuable these things become.
