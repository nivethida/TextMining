4154,1156576analyzed.txt,2015/8/19,"Damn, the price was steady before, but btc is crashing today again, unluckily I didn't dump my bitcoin when it was 300 USD, still have 7-8 bitcoins now, why btc is crashing again???; ;Fork rumors ? Thanks Gavbut lets hope for the best right yeah rumors spread and alot became afraid so they exchange their bitcoins I also have quite a large number of coins but I'm holding and buying in little by little. Sometimes the best time to be buying is when there is 'panic' like this going on. Hopefully it will all be resolved next month in the workshop to be held. I believe we will see a correction in price once clear direction has been established. If not then so be it.Not sure but I think many are dropping their holdings until this whole fork debate has been resolved.This Price fluctuation of Bitcoin can continue till the fork in January.; Only after that fork, Bitcoin price can stabilize. Wow, fork will be in January? That's a long time, so I have time to make more fiat to buy cheap bitcoins now, awesome, haha, I hope bitcoin will be lower so I can buy more bitcoins.; If bitcoin price again go down after you buy, what you do? instead pray for going high and buy now.you can not say crashing actully it is not crashing because i have seen this value before and its not bad at all deffinatly not crashing if it go below 100$ then i will say its crashing its value and you can expect a rise in few weeksIf you forgot to dump early or on top you can still dump your bitcoin for good deals on the LTC/BTC market or another altcoin market of your choice. Some people panic to sell there bitcoinit is not end of the world or some kind of drama. you have to just relax, focus more something else and check price later. and of course that one bitcoin is 1BTC tomorrow or day after. Why is everybody stressing and spreading panic?uhh it is so simple to answer - of course HODL - what else?Early adopters will definitly hold because they was present with old forks that happened etc .. and they know how the stuff works .That's probably nothing and I guess it will continue going down and down till January 11 when that fork happens . I myself im in panic but I'am trying to hold my self from doing stupid shit , I earned my BTc without any efforts so whatever happens happens I suppose there is nothing we could do about it .People in general and investors are afraid to lose their money so they are dumping while they can , I'am not sure what the twin brothers did though they have millions invested in BTC ;apparently is very easy to instigate panic selling, well more cheap cons for the other, see this as a donationjanuary, where is the source of this, would you mind writing it ? because i thought it was around 1 marchIt could be much later or never Visit http://xtnodes.com/ and put your mouse when you see mine or Look the tooltip on the right on the TOP : Good luck for ya. Doesn't look good. Shit is on TV too. Your friends gonna give you the looks, that's for sure. So at the very least you have 4 more months with lots of FUD, bad news and no buyers. That could be topped off with a screwed up fork that renders bitcoin completely worthless. Developers muddy the waters, and that the price fallsi think everyone should simply forget about bitcoin until the halving, then turn back here and you will see a nice surprise, let this whole mess resolve first, ignore bitcoin for the time beingMany main media published the ""Fork-Story"" yesterday - this was basically an announcement of a dump. As always. Shut, just went to bed, checked the price again and saw it down on 161. Could byte my arse didn't stand up to buy some...This developer war to see who has the biggest support, is just a smoke screen for the real explosion to come in 2016. Let them panic, so that we may profit. We have seen this many times before and we will still see it for many years to come.; I like it when the people sell, with any small bump in the road. We getting rid of the speculators and we pick up some cheap coins. seriously though i don't think the dump was about the fork debate/war but more someone or group, trying to panic the market for quick profits, as it was triggered too instantly.i don't think its been dumped hard...............yet ;I think we have to wait a few days to see if there is a panic or just a correction.The price is now at what you would expect it to be without the Greek hype. Seeing the price development for the past year we are spot on target with a price ranging from 220 to 250.Catch the Falling knife I dares ya!; Bitcoin isn't dumping hard, lol. And it's definitely not because of a fork that's coming in almost half a year... It's just the usual suspects messing with small traders to squeeze some coins of of them.https://cryptowatch.de/bitfinex/btcusd/1hrnot hard? 40k btc dump to 162$\x85.if this not hard? what is hard for you? Also, this thread is in the wrong section.This is what happens when we start involving politics and forcing updates with a 'fork'. I knew that nothing really good could have come out of this. The news articles about investors panicking were somewhat right. Let's just hope that Bitcoin can overcome this and become stronger than ever. This is only the beginning.Lots of people craving for cheap coins.Everything was dumped and rebuyed in minutes.Do you mean the beginning of more dumps?Gotta love that flash crash, I wish I was able to pick up more cheap coins! The recovery was pretty quick back up to $230~Looking at the charts it's starting to feel like the good old days with $70 swings in minutes. The past six months have been a period of new-found stability in the Bitcoin market, stability is not the norm for Bitcoin at all. With more institutional traders getting involved it almost makes me wonder if we'll be able to see another bubble with how quick traders are to take profit during rallies. I do not want to admit it, but the drop from $255 to $225 was quite ""hard"". Last time price fell like that was in March/April.I believe you are right. The actual forking does little harm, it's the politics that worries investors. If I am an investor, I would sit on the sideline and wait this one out.It s a dirty Job but someone have to do it.1BTC today will be less tomorow if the fork happensIts pretty gross how easy it is to manipulate.Pre-fork coins worth much more than after-fork coinsmost investor don't care to learn the truth about the block size debate, they only care about their pockets, give them one reason that bitcoin might be dead in the next few months and they'll move to something more safe.I thought something like this would happen, just not so soon.Now, since this has happened so early, I am afraid that this leaves us vulnerable for more of the dumps like this until the uncertainty about this block size mess doesn't get sorted. Yes, this was really early. I couldn't believe how low we have dipped on Bitfinex when I woke up. I mean close to 50,000 coins. This was some scared investor that doesn't understand the block size debate very well. With the prospect of a hard fork and this lack of consensus , I think it's safe to say that we will see a lot of negative pressure in priceIt sucks that such a small amount of btc can crash the price so hard.; It was only a 10k sell on finex and that triggered all the margin calls.; Bitcoin still has a long way to go.; ;Just think how the market would react to a 10k sell at $5,000 per coin?I don't like leaving money on exchanges: this is why a lost this turn. I have to find a way to be quick in these occasions. It could have been a good way to buy cheap.The beginning of more fun to come.Yes that is like that but this is just of profit when it dumped so hard so when we look at charts price is acting like this a big rise happen and start moving to up and after reaching at high point than it moving down again that strategy is repeating from few last months so better hold and never sell in panic.i choose holding my bitcoin because i m sure with it FUDER hiring some people to troll at bitcoincomunity so many people panic with it and sell his bitcoin "
4155,1156576analyzed.txt,2015/8/20,"I think the price reflects on the whole bitfnex incident of their sell off of their rogue employee or some insider crap. I dont thin it has to deal with a troll community.i agree, personally i think it's a crazy thing sell your bitcoin at 210/220$ each!!!! hodlpeople do weird things when they see the price go down real hard. they try to reduce the losses by selling and to later buy back more coins for the same $ amount.I see the price at same level as yesterday when I left, around 235.where is the crash?I know for sure my friend would be selling it so hard since he hasnt seen most of the other crash moments. Anyone whos selling is because they never seen a recover or just doesnt want to deal with the recover time it takes. or people are just panicing lol.this is not dumping just the value is droping when bitcoins rise it rise like hell and when it drop is drop same as but the current value is same as yesterday so its not actully dumping Bitcoin has had two major runups, both driven by external use cases. The first was Silk Road I drug sales, and the second was getting around China's capital controls. Both of those were shut down. Without a new big use case, there's no particular reason to expect another runup. For the first half of 2015, the price was $225 \xb1 25.; That's where it is now. What's the problem?"
4156,1156576analyzed.txt,2015/8/21,"Yes since yesterday the prices are around 235 range. Do not know what is happing in trading?Edit 2: The market is trying to tell the Bitcoin community something. It is time we listened. Edit 1: Bitcoin XT with just the blocksize increase and none of the ""extras"" is a perfectly viable solution. The reality is that Bitcoin has to fork and allow the blocksize to increase if it is to remain relevant. The problem is the resistance in certain quarters to increasing the max blocksize over 1 MB that has led to the XT solution and the current impasse. All I can sadly say is that I have followed Bitcoin since August 2011 and have owned Bitcoin since October 2011, yet this is the first time I have serious doubts about Bitcoin's future. My problem is that every time a new ""price floor"" comes in, the bar is lowered, and peoples expectations drop, and people leave btc all together.; I think if anything the market is shrinking as more people get burned.; That means every time a dump happens, it takes less people ""dumping"" to have an effect.; I just think too many people have had these grand expectations, lost money, and are too scared/frustrated to even think about getting back inif price up sell it don't waiting to 1000$; you must be realistis Bitcoin is high risk if you can control your emotion  Sources etc.True story.It's because everyone is selling there Bitcoin so they can buy XT coins.and he will sell if he need money to pay cost of life and he did'nt think about price so that a realistycsome people get free bitcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1146084.0;topicseenlook at this thread some one hiring troller "

With bitcoin xt we can identify the ip addresses of all bad bitcoin users and judge them accordingly in a show trial.but, in terms of an attack on bitcoin, what if one of these large mining pools is attacked/goes down...does it just result in really REALLY long wait times for confirmations, or lost coins or what?this is the same as btc itself, its becomign concentrated in the hands of a few bitcoin elite, aka whales.No wonder the price is so volatile with this Internet of Things casting its dark shadow over breakfast time Will this disrupt my usual breakfast routine? Will I need to pay a fee to the Internet of Things for this transformation from bread-warmer to block-finder? Can I pay in orange juice and/or other breakfast-related items? Will I be able to spend the BTC my toaster generates on non-breakfast items like soup or dessert?Now I will sue you, I want even more cheaper coinsno 150 so far.The people posting FUD here aren't doing shit to the price.

A swarm of FUD topics can definately make a difference...It\xb4s not a trollish thread in general, but you can be sure to find some trollish tendencies if you look closely enough...I'm going to warm up by suing the OP for implanting the idea in my mind. Okay OP, im going to sue Satoshi Nakamoto for not emailing me about the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 so I could buy 1 million Bitcoins for peanuts and then I will sue Karpeles for not telling me he was pumping the price into the moon.This ^ lolyou might want to sue mt gox or even mark karpeles directly, I think everyone that lost BTC is having really great luck with that...You might want to sue Wall Street too--DJIA is down over 200 points today and will slide further if it breaches 17,000."
4161,1156627analyzed.txt,2015/8/22,"At a time like this where Bitcoin XT is trying to take effect, I wouldn't be surprised about a price change. One can't be certain Bitcoin XT will 100 percent have an affect, but the fact remains that Bitcoin will have a shaky road. I was rather on the fence when the jump that took place a few months ago was going to sustain itself and keep rising. It looked very promising but we're right back at the place we've started prior to that jump in price."
4162,1156643analyzed.txt,2015/8/19,"What do u think guys the price will be after this XT drama going on, I am thinking around $180-$150 Will be the new bottom low and may even trigger a crash if users panic sell because of crashing price. What do u think?Or, more likely, another period of strangely stable (given BTC has no fundamental value in dollar terms) $200-300 prices.It's the beginning of the end. The glitterati of bitcoin as splitting up into different factions. There are no broad sunlit uplands, only a valley of darknessBitcoin was just fine the way it was. Why did these retards come in a fuck shit up? Is it necessary to be so melodramatic?;   so far by polls we are seeing the people are losing faith in bitcoin because of this XT Drama. I think its the best time to sell and wait for the drama to finish if you cant see huge swings on the exchange rate. and buy when the price is low.Humans are corrupted by Greed and Profit XT drama is just another attempt to make Bitcoin move forward. It all depends on Bitcoin.All other discussions, motives, like Snowden, XT, attacks and such are.. just diversions.And don't forget that USD is getting stronger every day and Bitcoin is mostly calculated in USD, so Bitcoin is still good.It was rather high lately, but that doesn't mean much. If it will go under 210 then yes, it's time to panic. Else.. it's normal, especially now, since people are back from holidays and started playing again on the market.Bitcoin was for rather long time up and down mostly between 210 and 290.Every time RSI went below 30, the price has ralliedonce or twice a year something like this happens and the prices drop hard. i see it as a great opportunity to buy where others very much panic and sell all their coins. Human greed is one of the factors that will make Bitcoin mainstream, the tech is legit and we all know Blockchain's potential is enormous.""Blood in the streets"" in my main strategy for real investing. I have done quite well doing the opposite of the market. My advice for making money in an investment market is to do the opposite of what the mob is doing.So with each step downwards in the price of BTC, you buy a bunch more, and then lose a bunch more money with the next step downwards?You would've nearly doubled your money with the 166 moment a few weeks later. Just as a dump is near inevitable these days, so is a reasonable rise. Maybe it'll stay in the $2-300 range until 2140 when only descendants of the original manipulators are still trading with each other to honour them. "
4163,1156643analyzed.txt,2015/8/20,"You also gotta see how people would react on the whole hard fork situation that has yet to happen.. so factor that event sooner eventually. I only the new low will be the high lows of $100ish.but not with lower than that, i hope it starts climbing the charts again to at least 260im ok with the new low of $220-$230I have given up hope on the bitcoin price for long term or short term. But I really don't think we will see below 200 anytime soon due to the XT drama. It will likely hold on to the 200$ spot as the rock bottom. Not a chance, that won't happen nor stay in that range for that long of a period. I'm surprised at you coming in like that. This crap will blow over and the recovery will begin. Some of you feel despair and dejection really hard. The move up will happen at some point in the near to medium future, that's all. No one can tell you a moon date.If people paid attention to mam lambpup when this happened back in January they'd still be freaked out at this point. Price has strengthened today after yesterday's dog show in the gutter. If you believe in bitcoin and what it will offer you always find solace and buy the dip. Otherwise, you bail and leave cause you want no part in this realm. Big money is accumulating at these ranges while the nervous nennies fold and run. If you want to achieve what bitcoin can offer, you have to stomach the downturns w/ a smile. Or, sell, turn tail & U-turn and miss out when the parabolic begins. The halving is coming later next year so you do the math. This drama over the blockchain expansion won't be in the mix by then. So, call it like you see it or let the infamous troll lead you to the door.fart factoryWhat if it reaches around like $170.. man that would be some depressing #`s to see esp when we took awhile to stable the mid $200 mark. Do you think it`ll go lower then that though?I don't think so. First the bitcoin XT must show how strong it is and this need time to be verified. Then can be discussed about the price of both of them Bitcoin has a respectable story behind its shoulders and this story cannot go down immediately. I think that bitcoin will survive and I hope tha both groups will be in one mind about the future of this big invention.Omg 65% people think the price will go down because of XT,Why do people lose faith so quickly goodluck to us.. i think it will go lower than $170-$120 but after that it will go straight up to 1000$-$2400 wildly. lets see what will happen. this will be interesting.If there is no solution it could be below even $10 ..... because the block chain is useless with the fork .... i GuessSo if it goes down like you are dreaming how much you will buy but i don't it will go down below than $220 and it will again start moving to rise.I, for my part, am interested in Yuan and Euro, while USD is considered weak - and getting weaker. Why do you think that Bitcoin is tied to the USD? Do you really believe that Chinese care a lot about USD-Bitcoin? Or Europe? Russia?If you look at the timing of the dump, it is pretty obvious: BBC reported about the possible fork, many media around the world picked the story up - it seems as if financial guys who don't understand the technical aspects panicked and sold a lot of coins. Combined with some flaws in the Bitfinex-exchange, this created a mess.If that will be all the people buy at 170-120 are lucky they the more profits BTCitcoin will never go under from price range $220 because it is stable at this floor from past 7 months every time when it comes to down it stays it this level and than again a big bubble happen and go up and come down again and again, so stop dreaming to get lower than $220. This time its different, Because of XT Drama going on we may see the price to go below $220They may be unlucky to it could start a crash if the price goes this down and bitcoin may die for a while, But it can skyrocket again from bottom if its resurrected.I gave my vote for; 210$-200$ on temporarily basis because I am quite sure price is not going anymore down than this level.All this happening we say is accumulation and spreading the coins among new investors and in coming days we will again rise in price.i think this xt 'drama' will have its effect on the price for a few more weeks. it's clearly not over yet. one large dump can trigger a lot panic sellers to sell their coins.ofcourse i will invest more when it happens... because it is my chance even im not an early adapters. because i believe that when it really goes down that much ,after that it will go straight already. that is according to my research. and that is the reason i am here..; nowhere but somewhere near moonafter the xt drama passed, and with halving approaching?yup exactly, I didnt know bitcoin back then but this time i will be ready. What i am looking for is a panic sell  And when the bad news are at the end that will be the right time to buy as much we can and with halving for close, I think btc will goto the moon "

People lost faith at this point by design and are down and out so they're likely the last of the weak hands if they currently have coins and are expressing sentiment.

And now everyone is hoping for $250.It was just some weeks before the bitcoin XT drama started that everyone was saying that Bitcoin to $300 at the end of August. $210 now on btc-e$216 on preev now so it is selling below $210 for now, Lets hope it doesnt starts a panic sell.World of bitcoin  No one can predict a day ahead Still, with the World falling apart; China >10% down, Latin American currencies in a 22 years low, oil at 39USD, Bitcoin isn't suffering much.216@BitcoinWisdom too.Will we break the $200 barrier shortly?$207 on btc-e.looks like in 24 hours it will be 1BTC to $199 USD, lets wait and see and maybe it will just play around $210-$220You seriously compare latin american currencies with bitcoin? I think bitcoin is more often pegged with USD/EUR.Bitcoin should be doing better than, If other fails bitcoin should succeed, This is basic economics, Gold is crashing oil is at $39. But; bitcoin should be booming but this is not the case instead it is crashing too.lets hope so but the trend is getting little permanent yeah at this rate within 24 hours i think bitcoin will be below; $200, and this XT drama will last till January so this means it will continue to drop.Still, by it's store value use, Bitcoin is more up to be comparable to bullion, such as silver or gold, other than fiat currencies.I wasn't comparing BTC to nothing, as investment options aren't linearly comparable.I think the new low will be under 200$ soon just in couple of days.All this is uncertain situation and there is no new investment to support the prices.This is opportunity for some investors to make entrance in Bitcoin's world.Most of it is because we dont know how the whole xt situation will do after the hard fork is done. I think the true price range would be high mid 100ish like 170 until people figure out what xt will do.seeing that there's no noticable wall anywhere, probably we'll go to $190 ish. though hopefully someone will pump the price up before we go under $200.$213 the last time I checked and it's got no signs of slowing down.Being positive, at least it's a good day to buy.I love it when i'm right Bitcoin could fucking hit a 150$ low, if this shit continues.I even changed my avatar from a strong bitcoin head with 2 muscular arms, into a faded dark bitcoin (due to crappy devs) whereas the Litecoin will shine above.Now I`m getting scared, I am moving half of my bitcoins into litecoin."
4167,1156643analyzed.txt,2015/8/25,"It's your opinion but I hope you guys are wrong and bitcoin stays above $200Looking at the pol results shows 50% believe price will be below $200its a nice gauge of market sentiment. Maybe we'll see an all time high of BTC Swaps and then everyone short can now get screwed over in a double whammyLtc could go to 10-20$ by december if bitcoin turns out to be a mess, if not then atleast we are hedged no?It looks like as if massive selloff has stopped . I`m moving some of my funds into LTC for safety, although I still think LTC can go to 2$ so i`ll wait until the LTC bubble deflates it will be quicker, then if the 190$ level holds for bitcoin then i`ll be happy.Personally now i am believing $210-220$ will be the bottom low even with the XT Drama.$220+ on preev now, Looks like bitcoin is going back up again. What has caused this? Any good news going around? I think bitcoin will be a better place if people could learn not to panic, What we see all the time is people who want to get rich fast start to panic sell bitcoin if bitcoin falls by few dollars. Then something good happens and the price starts to restore and they come back again.I hope it stays to $220 or higher, but not lower than $200This is nice, it's climbing back to $220; I just feel that Litecoin has a brighter future in 2015 than Bitcoin, but we shall see.Watch when they will do implement it, then it will be more interesting where the price will go. I think it could git 150$ again, but it definitely seems to me that 150$ is the maximum low it can be, or atleast in my view it is.Well this was only the prologue, they havent implemented anything yet, this was just a pre-panic event.so you are getting bearish. i don't think we'll see the price go to $150 as that is way too low. i'm sure the xt drama will cool down and everything will get back to normal."
4168,1156643analyzed.txt,2015/8/26,"many people are believing in bitcoin and the number should increase ....I too hope that this bullshit drama ends sooner and it gets back to where it was...Of course after it ends , i think this will be the last time when we will see bitcoin below 200$.Price could go to 150$ and stay there if all hell breaks lose, the traders are very sensitive to this issue and they panic easily, so i`d not sit this one out just doing nothing. On mid term i`m bearish, especially after september when they reach a consensus at that workshop where the devs will meet. It could cause some ripples and if you dont like big drawdowns then it is my opinion to move some bitcoins into some better altcoins.On the long term I`m bullish, no doubt about that, bitcoin could replace the fiat system easily, and since its the numero uno, it has a high success rate.Timeframes , timeframes, timeframes."
4169,1156644analyzed.txt,2015/8/19,"Please repost this text and than people will now that a fake story about Bitcoin-XT is just a bullshit. Only the one thing I can say you exactly - after falling BTC price will go up to the new heights. I can say it as a developer of the most effective automatic BTC trading bot. What to do now? You can sell your Bitcoins and than you will make a BTC price go down. Than you will be able to buy more cheap BTC. But be careful - maybe right after the moment when you sold your Bitcoins, BTC price will go up immediately. I can say ""F#ck off!"" to these guys. You can say it too and never let them a chance to control YOUR bitcoins. Just ignore xt fork and forget about it. Because XT can track your IP and you will not be anonymous anymore. XT can block your IP or account and you will lose your money. XT code can be modified at any time and it will be able even to record a video from your webcam or to steal your personal data. XT is controlled by couple of people. Original Bitcoin is not controlled by somebody.It's clean that they wrote a fake Satoshi's email.It's nothing. Who are Mike Hirn and Gevin Anresen? Just nobody. They want to be owners of your Bitcoins and control the whole system. Not only the funds, but the principles and freedoms. And the legend for the price manipulation is a fake Satoshi Nakamoto's email that Bitcoin-XT is a dangerous fork. As a result - somebody will gain a lot of Bitcoins and will receive a huge profit. The most of the usual Bitcoin users and investors will lose their money. And than guys, which made a panic on a market, will buy a huge amount of cheap BTC. It will make BTC price go up to the new high rates. Than Bitcoins will be sold much higher, than it were bought. Some of the real holders will sell their BTC for lower prices. Other will not buy new BTC, because they ;think that BTC price will go down deeper. But a really huge amount of users do not understand this. While all these Bitcoins are holded for the future, market price indicators show only the price of the last sold 5 000 BTC, not the real BTC price. When somebody sell 5 000 BTC for a cheap price, it does not mean that other 14 000 000 BTC are cheap.Bitcoin trading volumes are low, that's why current price manipulation is easy.It seems than somebody wants to drop BTC market down to the bottom selling BTC now. Bitcoin XT is it a ScamWhat to do now? You can sell your Bitcoins and than you will make a BTC price go down. Than you will be able to buy more cheap BTC. But be careful - maybe right after your Bitcoins selling, BTC price will go up immediately. I can say ""F#ck off!"" to these guys. You can say it too and never let them a chance to control YOUR bitcoins. Just ignore xt fork and forget about it. Because it is controlled by couple of people. Original Bitcoin is not controlled by somebody.Yes. A personal trojan instead of BTC. Bitcoin XT is may not be a Scam. ;But Bitcoin XT want to capture entire Bitcoin network into their hands. ;This may lead to create problems to Bitcoin and its investors in future.In case of Bitcoin core you will be free, because nobody will know your personality. In case of xt any federal agent will know who you are.Also, you will go to the prison for all your life, because tomorrow your democratic government will create a law that all cryptocurrency holders should be arrested. I even do not say that you already should be arrested for your site In the xt your Bitcoins can be blocked, and you will lose all your BTC. Is not it a scam? Well, if you have a Bitcoins, you have it and nobody can block your account. Calling it a personal trojan is a little dramatic but it is an attempt to circumvent the consensus methods in place for making changes to bitcoin core because it appears that the devs are incapable of reaching consensus on this issue. In my opinion block size is not the biggest issue here, it is how the issue of reaching consensus is reached by the core devs that will have lasting ramifications. The only point to avoid XT is if you don't trust gavin and if you don't like 8MB blocks and think that it should be lower or IDK.XT is just a fork of Bitcoin core. It only puts more things and the devs that will ""control"" the source will be different.Based on what you're saying this bs?I don't think that bitcoin market is unique and separate in this sense and don't think that we can do anything to change this situation.Small investors then sell their shares in panic and big investors are buying them and later earning big profits.Big players always manipulate the market and creates an artificial panic among small players.What you just explained here are common marketing rules anywhere, in any kind of free market.Only a fraction of those 14000000 BTC are in circukation. If all BTC suddenly appeared on the market the price would drop like a rock so the real price is likely much lower than todays price. If the market price on BTC was based on 14000000 BTC then a dump of 5000 BTC would have had a minimal effect or no effect at all.;XT will destroy Bitcoin as decentralized network; and it will create only few super-nodes what will be able to handle 8GB blocks. Then It is easy to control(or shut down) this few nodes by government.Even worse. "

It's only 13% move.Boys and girls who played with leverage just got busted and lost their money. It was margin call on bitfinex. The whole fork thing must be having an impact for sure too. Lots of people that don't know whats going on (which is in fact the majority of people out there) instantly think of a doomsday scenario whenever something happens within the Bitcoin world.Not sure what has the market spooked like this but I'm sure the price will recover again, if not this week maybe the next or even a couple after that. I'm in it for the long run so will buy a bit on the dips and see where this goes. ;Placed some buy orders on $196, $185 and $170.I think we might see a dip below $200 before heading up again.cause this is real fact we should to face.but, never give up, and stay trying if want to succes. just enjoyed, high or down the price, its okey.this is risks with BTC, we daring to join here, we should during to encounter with anything risks will be happen..okey... as we know if the price is not stability.. I am not losing faith in bitcoin, but it is hard to keep getting beat down for so long. It used to be that way, thanks in part to Mark and his shenanigans on MtGox. Now it has been more of a relaxing steady decline with a few little small climbs. the more important right now is how many can you get until the price get higherbut if you have some faith in bitcoin price drop when there lot who sell bitcoin..I don't care at all about the price. That doesn't matter. The real issue is with the future of BTC, and its scalability. What is going to happen is the number of transactions grow ten-fold? This is the real problem.The blocksize and XT debate is huge, and that has to be reflected in price.And that, I think, is what many have perceived, have sold, and have brought the price down.I'm not scared as I just sold my bitcoins yesterday when the price was $250-$260. The price has reached $220 almost and it has come back to the amount it was at 2 months back and it will again increase. I wonder when it will get above $300 now as since months it's stuck on $200-$300.We have been in 2XX the whole year,and even 1XX, that was just a flash dump and produced that price,it will go up againWhy scare?Bitcoin is really 5-10 years away from being mainstream imo.; Buy coins now and put them in cold storage and forget about day to day price swings or you will go gray.; Now if price doesn't get a bump around the halving I will be a little concerned.Plus the fed rate stuff today, not sure how relevant but i'm willing to bet a hike will cause a further drop, and that the xt drop isn't over yet on top of it.not the price, it is the events surrounding the price that are scary.; Some will say manipulation....no shit, but its seems rather convenient timing considering the xt garbage.Trust is hard to win and easy to loose. Thank Gavin for that shit, he ruined it pretty much with his childish behaviour. He needs to go, maybe then we can recover. I say double digits by years end. Recovery will be slow. It's looking rather not so good for the upcoming months or years. Coud well fork in two chains, then what? People don't take that risk. The blocksize war is scaring investors away. Gavincoin, nodewar, hardfork, hostile takeover, bloated blockchain, etc. Where do you guys live? In the bushes? It's on television, ""bitcoin at risk of split""i have a good feeling Bitcoin price will increase and back to it previous floor price at 280no i'm not scaredThis Friday is my normal time to buy. It seems like I never get to catch one of these dips.Grrrrr,Not scared here just another normal day!ive never seen the price drop below 200 $ will the low priced sell orders just be soaked up by people with a strong handThe only thing scary about the current price is how easily the market can be manipulated.; The big wall street boys will have a field day if this market isn't secured before trading goes live.; I assume that's why the Winkiis are currently onboarding institutional customers before launching their exchange and ETF.This is simply not the case. A trader made a large ""poop and scoop"" on bitfinex last night, leading to the flash crash and subsequent rebounds. However, the volatility caused some panic sells,allowing the price to drop. The debate may have induced some of the panic, but it is not the cause. after price touching 170 this year, I'm kind of imune to fear caused by dumps and fudWill BTC recover its public image?; I dont know, but if I'm a retailer, I'm staying the heck away...no this isn't the first time this has happened, but the whole sell sell sell at the drop of a hat thing is kind of getting old.it is scary, actually its unnerving too.; I think the fact that now we've seen how fragile btc price is people will be very cautious about buying and holding for any period of time.When it finally increases there won't be much warning and if you aren't holding btc at that point there will be some crying bears. The price drops fast but don't forget it's a two way thing. It could increase rapidly too.Be greedy/bullish when others are fearful. Nvertheless have some cash ready, if some early adopters like Mpex are going to sell-off their bitcoins. -> Very bullish sign!!!If no solution is found it means we are either forking or we are not. In the first case many early adopters will sell their stash resulting in really cheap prices, which is good in the long run because it favors broader distribution! In the second case nothing will happen.If a solution for the conflict is found say ""goodbuye"" to the current prices.The most of us seem to have forgotten, when to buy. Currently there is enormous uncertainty in the market. That is great, if you have the balls to invest now.Oh yeah! When there's blood in the streets.... remember! I am not afraid of this market manipulation... it was manipulated in November 2013, it is manipulated today and it will be manipulated again in the future because BTC market has no liquidity: it's easy for speculators to cause drastic changes in the BTC price.I'm not scared. Just bored. Today the last or second last day of Minima.This was all due to Lazy FUD XT , hope bitcoin will take a dip to minimum of 200$ and will then again hike up with proud , leaving all nasty haters.I'm holding my coins, but for the first time am really debating the wisdom of doing so.I don't get why two guys, who have to have a lot of bitcoin, are pushing this fork so hard and dropping the value of their bitcons so dramatically. ;Two weeks ago we were knocking on the door of 300 USD, now I agree, looks like below 200 is very possible.The price drop leads me to think that the XT fork is hurting the coin. ;However, I appreciate that it might just have been a margin call, that would be great."
4190,1157118analyzed.txt,2015/8/20,"why would it? surely we can all grasp that the people with the power to manipulate the market to get cheap coins also want to manipulate it up sell those same coins for as high a price as possible at some future stageIs the price scaring anyone?Final despair.It will all be ok. Price will go up leading to the halving, this just probably a attempt to dump the price one last time before it takes off.Someone using the ""uncertainty"" of the fork as reason to dump, just as Greece was a reason to pump. Gemini will be here soon and the price will be going up. Manipulation is big right now. It will decrease when market cap gets bigger most likely, unless they orchestrate together. Or the transfer times of people knowings whats going on with the btc xt process. traditional wallet owners not online ones will see a difference in speed but not sure how much it`ll weigh in to effect price. I feel the real scare will come once we actually get to the bitcoin split.which is most likely not to happen anywaysi will get scared when bitcoins price is less than a dollar just hope for the best why get scared lol i always think that the price is always changing for the better in the futurenot yet, but if it continues this way, it will scare me.The reasons for this crash appear to point to margin trades that occurred on the major Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex and not the controversy rising from the Bitcoin fork.There should be a Search bar at the top right of your screen- Use it!If you had of researched this for 1 second you would have found your answer instead of starting a new thread.I thought that a member with PM if you wanna make some money as his personal text would know what is happening with the BTC price, especially since we are at such a critical point in time for bitcoin. ;Wiser words were never spoken. When the real bull market takes off after the tepid have tasted and sold, there'll be sad faces all around but many happy bulls. Bitcoin only rewards those that have taken a major blow to their usd value of this coin and then moves on up into the clouds. So, if you don't have a stomach lining made of steel in these parts, be tough or just sell to whoever will buy you out. Or, if you're a troll, just sell out and leave at this point.Hence why people did sell off, unless the bitcoin xt serves the scale part since it process or helps more transaction if speed is the real issue. I guess most people see it to not scale so well.No im stll holding my bitcoinIt usually does some bull crap recovery out of no where back to high #`s. We can feel this way for years on out, and it`ll be 2020 and still see this. Btw, the current price is making me feel like the recovery will be huge for some odd reason. This feeling will never die.BTC can go to $1 for all I care. I'm long-term hodl.this price is a great opportunity for people who haven't bought yet to do it now. if they still don't buy then they are too scared or waiting for a price that will never happen anymore.This Gif didn't explain reality ... bitcoin has been free fall in last years ....so if someone were to buy right now, and btc goes to $1, that'd be over a 99% loss.; how does holding make a difference? just inclinate the left side of your screen but 45 degrees and you will have the correct feeling Price never scary others . SomeThings like xt bitcoin , few coins for all people in the earth , probability across privkeys and other thing scare people .I'm lovin' it! Time for some McDonald's, yum."
4191,1157118analyzed.txt,2015/8/21,"Yes just start buying some small quantities to jump into the bitcoin world. But one should be prepared for worst case also.We have never under $200 this year for a longer time. So the low 200s is a great entrance point.Nope.It's not scaring me. It's more the opposite. This year is a great opportunity to accumulate more coins for a really good price.Not scaring me at all. We are still well over the 160 bottom in January 2015. We had huge resistance at 200 this time and are only down a net of 15 bucks after flash crashing from 250. Then we will see who is having balls and who not. I am praying to see this Hope it will drop under $100. IMO just a question of time.i am not scared at all, im more scared when the price starts to go up fast as it can possibly make me rich if it will go up fasta few months back I thought it would drop to double digits, now I am about 90% certain it will.; It may only stay there for a VERY short time, but if you are paying attention and have buy orders set you should catch some cheap coins.; THOSE would be some ""cheap coins"".; All you gotta do is follow the news, and when the dissent/disagreement within the btc community gets bad, then the price will probably go down that far, for a short whileHow do you set up automatic buys on coinbase? Say, for example, if I want to automatically purchase X amount of coins if the price touches $200? I still check the price everyday, it's something I still need; I will admit. but this is a long term investment, and I am glad , 'cause one day in the future I'll be able to just relax and look back at these times and just laugh.Should I be worried? Any high level programmers here worried about the same thing?I'm not really scared of this low price, but I am scared that Bitcoin XT will be implemented and my coins will become unusable or worthless. From what I've gathered, if you aren't running a node, your coins will be safe regardless of what happens (both pre- and post-fork coins). If you are running a node on Core, and bitcoin XT prevails, you'll have to switch to not lose them. This price is scaring everyone; soon as the dust settles, and prices will recover, so in the longrun everyone is safe, until then, like i said, cash in on the fear and confusion.There is no reason to fear, because now is the time to cash in on the drop, sell and rebuy lower. The downfall will stop asit was obvious that the price will decline. As soon as developers and people at respected positions and followers in our little bitcoin word started bashing at each other with those xt vs core deathmatches,i have got no more to invest , so you think that 200 - 250$ is btcs stable point ? or do you think it will get a bit higher?OP the same thing is causing this price drop that causes every other price drop. Whales having a whale of a time playing on peoples fear about the forking mass debate; Cheesy (bitcoinxt drama) and not to mention getting some cheap coin for their troubles. Nope not everyone dude, there is a chance to stack some cheap coin. If you have spare funds don't miss it."
4192,1157118analyzed.txt,2015/8/23,"As for block size and transaction capacity, I think that depends on what Bitcoins most popular use case turns out to be.; If it's 100 people moving $10mill each per day then it's no issue.; If it's microtransactions of a few cents by a couple of billion people then it would be something that needs attention. XT/fork/disputes are a factor I'm sure, though less significant.I think the most probable scenario is that there is a human trader (or a group) with large resources gaming the bots.; When we get a large move it seems to rebound and then sit around for a while until the nerves settle to make sure it's not for a fundamental issue and just some gaming going on.; It also seems to sit in that area whatever 'that area' is, as if the actual price is not that relevant yet to many, just that nothing has happened that breaks the system.You wouldn't want to miss a bull run.The only problem is if the price suddenly shoots up and you keep waiting for cheaper coins.i think is better that way ...maybe the price of bitcoin will stop around 250$ ...is not so good to oscillate from 1000 to 200 ..The bitcoin project is failed in my opinion but is was a good start for changing the rule of economic relations and banking technologyThere is a lot of potentials to seeing price lower than $160 even $100 and even $10 again ..... Do not move the opposite direction of the trend market. the trend is sell so sell or hold your coins ...... never bought Steps by Steps at lower levels ......All bitcoiner keep hold your bitcoin The first price is only 10cent come on don't compare it, dont make people scaredThe price will fall whenever their is uncertainty or bad news or eve rumors or news.Price doesn't scare me. I'm used to this behavior now. I'm sure this wont be the last predicament that causes a fall in value.It's a happy moment for me, I suppose both up and down work just fine and make no difference in meaning. lolIf I had the funds, I would rack up as much bitcoins as I could. Bitcoin is still at an infant stage, more and more companies and individuals will be slowly attracted towards the decentralised currency. Which means things can only get better henceforth"
4193,1157118analyzed.txt,2015/8/24,"Every one is thinking it will become better and better but since last one year btc price nothing has improved so need to be very careful when you buy more quantity at one time.this forum is full of people comparing the bitcoin price now to when it was 2013. for some reason they are too much thinking about the +$1000 peak in 2013. people must look forward and focus on new levels as $300 and $400, and not $1000.I think its great that some larger companies like dell and overstock have started to test the waters and take btc, but reading about the losses incurred by overstock, I doubt many more will be jumping to start taking btc, at least any time soon. I'm not sure how simply being decentralized would be attractive to companies.But it is not scaring me and I am currently laughing at those people who are selling their bitcoins at this much low prices. The price drop is due to the bitcoin XT drama. etc, etc, etc...Price of bitcoin at time of post: $260Price of bitcoin at time of post: $503You really think these are low prices? You would be sitting really good if you sold every time someone said this."
4194,1157291analyzed.txt,2015/8/19,Here's my chart with my prediction. More sideways movement for a couple more days. What do you all think?I do agree that this down trend can keep continue for couple of days and then again we will see up trend with huge investment again may be from next week or so.
4195,1157291analyzed.txt,2015/8/20,"Im ok with it. Every month with a 200ish BTC is another month where I can at least make 1 BTC minimum, so time to keep stacking guys, history will compensate us with tons of purchasing power. We Are Right."
4196,1157507analyzed.txt,2015/8/20,"Or are most of you poor and have little to no BTC?Anyone have any plans to buy soon?I have. Who else?I bought some the VERY NIGHT BEFORE the price dropped.; Such is life....I plan on buying in once the btc xt horror panic moment happens. But I guess it falls upon the age bracket on this forum.. and the average btc holder in general.; I personally lost a ton of btc back in 2012, but left with a few coins.Saying that we are too poor to go buy btc is a bit naive lol.It might get lower again, so I'm not in a hurry to buy a grip of coins right now. I think I'll just stick to my monthly buys and maybe I'll get lucky. I missed out on the cheap cheap coins yesterday, since I haven't been following the price as frequently as I used to. i am planning on buyingDo you not think the past few days have been capitulation related the ""xt horror panic"" ? I guess I personally hope it is, but am not real positive as we haven't really bounced that hard yet?Haha yeah well sometimes in order to get people's attention you have to be a little coarse!I think yeah people are worried, but they shouldnt be freaking out if the price will fall below what people would hope. Some people see it as a big change, but I feel its the same thing just things are going to be a bit slower? that guy is a bit extreme I think with the bitcoin xt comment.I don't think there was any capitulation. There were some forced liquidations on Bitfinex, but that's all. The rest of the exchanges just look bearish as hell. Naturally, some demand at the $220 previous bottom area but...... I don't see a capitulation spike on the Chinese exchanges, no volume spike...... no V bottom. Doesn't look like past major bottoms. Probably more slow bleeding to come.I bought a handful at $222 when it crashed and was on the rebound. Tried for $210 but the price skyrocketed back up before I could do it!; I've got a pretty decent stash in cold storage. I haven't bought any for a few months now though. I got to a certain amount that I was happy with in my head & locked them up on paper wallets. I will probably buy if we go sub 200 but don't have any plans to buy right now. That's only because I'm happy with the amount I've accrued for long term HODLING though, if I was a bitcoin noob with few coins I'd buy in now as these are cheap coins.I missed the chance to buy and I'm hodling btc for now.Bitcoin will be going up and down likely for all its life. It's just the nature of it. Personally I wont be buying any more as I stopped long ago as I have a sufficient amount now that I'll just save for the future and see where it goes.Nice. My recent buy was at $222 as well. I bought within 3 minutes or so of $162 on Finex, but where I was buying it didn't go nearly that low.; So eventually it`ll increase but for those who want to buy, it should be the recovering slow period is when to buy. I personally think theres more hurdles for bitcoin so I`ll wait on the sidelines after the XT and then the halving as well. I feel like its going to stay around those prices for this week.Just made a good decision at the right moment and want some profit off it. I have successfully brought some Bitcoins out of my bankroll in past few days and is currently looking a good investment and I'm looking forward for prices to increase in the upcoming months as halving period is coming closers. Oh well! No, I have missed it, I have been asleep. When I woke up and saw low of $162 on the Bitcoin widget,; I couldn't believe my own eyes. Somehow, all these major drops in price happen while Europe is asleep. I had a good amount of bitcoins, bought around 250-280, i now decided to convert them into litecoins since the potential, at least is what i think, its higher, i mean litecoins going from 3 to 4 will already give me more profit than bitcoin growing up 50 dollars and with the fork coming out it may go highThe government won't entirely disappear any time soon. You'll wish they would. In Rome it got so bad that the people just abandoned their land because the government was so oppressive. Later there was no government in Rome and only cows grazing in the city. But first the totalitarianism.The ""End of Government"" can mean many things. It can mean we still have governments exerting totalitarianism with the chaos of loss of rule of law (i.e. rampant corruption in government). Again study my upthread review of the decades long chaotic collapse of the Western Roman empire.This bounce back up is one more gift to go short before it is too late. Again the ""Only the Date is Unknown"". I don't know how far up the price will reach before crashing again or the timing. Volatility will increase.As more people capitulate to the reality that it is better to be short than long that is what drives the extreme low.(that is if you think you should abrogate your responsibility and sue anyone for the market price movements of BTC)But you are dumb and lazy, so you won't do that. And so you will remain ignorant. And I sort of like that, don't you?If you weren't dumb, you'd learn to stop ignoring me. You'd be clicking my Profile and reading all my archive of posts.After that, we will start a new bull market that will make investors rich.The bottom in the BTC price will come in Spring 2016, and it will be back below $100, perhaps even below $50.I reiterated these points over the past weeks in the Economics -> Speculation -> PnF and Economics -> Speculation -> Free Money threads. Even a few hours before the crash I reiterated these points again that everyone should have been short since $315.I've always been correct on BTC price in terms of the major moves. I was even correct in early 2013 when at $10 I gave my thumbs up to going all in.The retards who are buying now and not selling are going to lose and end up selling below $100.Anyone so egotistical and disdainful toward the crowd he is attempting to give ""advice"" to should be dismissed. No wonder nobody wants to collaborate with you, Anonymint.You confuse knowledge with ego. (did you ever consider I was trying to help you fool; )Your emotional problem is your problem, not mine. Are you sure you are a man? (check down there)Fools deserve their fate. Please dismiss. Smart money recognizes valid logic. That is how we end up with winners and losers.I know a big ego when I see one, and I haven't seen any bigger than musicians (that's my field) and programmers/developers. You, my friend should spend less time on forums giving financial advice in capital letters and more time with that great idea that will change the world. You're not gonna see $50 coins.Your emotional problem is your problem, not mine.Where do you trade? I'm interested in hearing the details of your short position.And why do you want to know where I hold my accounts...You are the one who is throwing your ignorance around and hurting readers.I give you the readers a ""heads up"" that your bullishness is the sign that the bottom has not been reached yet. The bottom comes when you the bullish fools finally in desperation go short. Then the smart money covers their short position, you fools are bankrupted, and the next bull market starts.You confuse ego with leadership. I am very cordial with people, but leaders don't lead into mud just so they can placate the stragglers and losers.Nearly everyone who has argued with me has ended up eating their words later.I hope you're right, but I'm afraid you're not. I have the feeling; <$100 per BTC won't happen, ever. If it will, I'm ready to buy a couple of bitcoin lol.At any rate, I won't waste any more of our time. But someone should take out an escrowed bet with you about these elusive $100 coins, though judging from your character I know you would not accept I stand by my predictions with real world positions. Can you say the same, or do you just want to make grandiose predictions to feed your overinflated sense of self?I know you well enough through your extensive body of writing. You narcissist--you give yourself away. Your ego is always first in line, isn't it? To be an objective investor you must remove your feelings, vested bias, personal bias, etc.. You must seek objective knowledge.Agreed let's not waste any more of each other's time.Confident delusion is a common attribute shared by fools.And narcissists.(the smoke is coming out your ears, lol. Fuck you, haha.; )Jealously is what causes others to accuse someone of being a narcissist. I post about ideas and knowledge. I have no deep knowledge about what your personal problem is with ideas and knowledge. But I don't care to waste my time trying to find out what your problem is (no desire to probe your anus where you ostensibly spend most of your effort). Of course you are politicking. Because ostensibly you have no ideas and knowledge (otherwise you'd be arguing the points of what I wrote about and not about me ad hominem). Q.E.D..Yes I have plans to but plans don't always work out do they.It is a shame I have to wait till the end of the month till I get some more spare pennies so I can buy some more and stop having such a small amount. Most of us poor and have little to no bitcoin lol Damn you must be rich and have loads of bitcoin, well atleast loads more than us poor folk. I brought a ""little amount"" all that I could afford ;"
4197,1157507analyzed.txt,2015/8/21,"Anyone who claims to know what the price of bitcoins or for the matter any other coin is totally lying because its basically impossible to determinate exactly what the price will go to, specially in a long period of time.Before the internet, a similar law existed that whoever shouted the loudest was right.he wrote in capital letters and he made them red, he must be telling the truth, it's an ancient law of the internet.i was on sleep when price drop and i'm shocked want to cried when i see price drop under $200. but now look price strong againExperience is earned. And now you will learn the hard way.And you will remain poor because you do not try to learn how and why I am able to do that. I have explained it in my archive of some 2000+ posts over the past few months (and another 50,000+ posts in my prior user names such as AnonyMint and on other forums).Then I've been doing a damn good job of lying, since I am always predicting the future.Since cryptos are not really based on anything it's impossible to determinate whether the price will go up or down or stabilize, if you can really predict the price, good for you, why tell others? You will just miss out on profit, you are a millionare by now i suppose, right?One does not get rich only by speculating. There is another way which I prefer which is actual production. Any way, why would any person want to have more wealth than they can use. Makes no sense, unless they are a sociopath.Tell others so that all the capital in our ecosystem won't end up concentrated in the fewer hands who know how to play the greater fool reality of investing."
4198,1157507analyzed.txt,2015/8/22,"i have bought when price drop in bitfinex, my order in price $210. i so disappointed not open order 2BTC or 3BTC but it's ok i get 0.1 in cheap price I succeeded to catch just 0.50BTC because my buy order was not that much.I was not expecting price drop just like others if I was knowing surely was buying more.All this is whale playing to scare the weak hands and soon will be huge rise in price all will see.We will not see a drop of price in coming days so whoever bought under 225 or so they will make huge profit in coming days.All this accumulation or whatever we say is about to be over and this time price will touch 350$ again soon.I do hope TPTB is right.. I would love to have an opportunity to buy bitcoins below 100 usd. Although it may be very painful to a lot of people...Which turned out to be bullshit.Then you are the same guy who believed BitcoinEXpress had a legitimate exploit for monero."
4199,1157727analyzed.txt,2015/8/20,"Also, to the panickers and people spreading fud, look at bitcoinrichlist.com. Do you see any of these big dawgs selling? No. I rest my case. There's a winner and a loser in every game. Once you sell you've lost. Once the XT drama is over and we're approaching the halving, no one has ANY excuse to whine about not getting a chance to buy enough coins. We've been in the 200's for almost a year. You can only blame yourself if you aren't and/or haven't been accumulating all year. So far in 2015 there have been excellent buying opportunities indeed.I would give up trying to wary people on the fact we are on the unique opportunity to buy cheap as hell Bitcoin once again for a very long time. If you haven't been hustling BTC during all of this year an continue to do so as long as buying 1 BTC monthly is a possibility, I really really dont know what you are doing with your life.Honestly, I'm not sure what the hell you said or were trying to say. Might want to pick up an English grammar book . they only make things cheaper for youJust accumulate while people panic sell and talk about single digits or somethingExactly. Nothing like getting rich at the expense of others; .http://bitcoinrichlist.com/top100 doesn't show fully valid data.Still a good indicator though. Doesn't hurt to keep an eye on it. Actually I've been involved since 2013, starting visiting these forums in early 2014, but never joined until 2015. Actually, it's worked out pretty well so far I must say. One should be very careful while buying because ""accumulate when others are panic selling"" is correct only you should be a discipline buyer. You shouldn't just jump and buy all at one time because we do not know the bottom yet. If it goes to 100 level then you will loose lot of money so buy progressively to gain more profits. As of now, do not know how long it will be down just wait and see ; Are people still complaining about not being able to buy any? I think if you haven't bought in yet a fall in price will just scare most people off. I think bitcoin price could go even lower given all the panic and confusion over the forking so if you were going to buy in maybe wait a bit.Oh they will because they're selling so they'll become that much more bitter when the price rises. Look at kwukduck. Sold all his coins at 10 bucks back in the day. I totally agree mate. I buy on a consistent regular basis but I also buy small handfuls when the price crashes a bit (like it just did). And I always leave plenty of fiat left over incase the price should crash to say $100 . I seriously doubt that will happen, but anything is possible. One should be very careful while buying because ""accumulate when others are panic selling"" is correct only you should be a discipline buyer. You shouldn't just jump and buy all at one time because we do not know the bottom yet. If it goes to 100 level then you will loose lot of money so buy progressively to gain more profits. As of now, do not know how long it will be down just wait and see; ;Those who are selling is because we cant afford the risk, while they can. If they are wealthy from the start they bought in coins or btc related services to hedge their loss I`m pretty sure.Well to be fair, the rich dont give a crap about price lol.Just keep quiet and acquire bitcoin.; ""But we could slide lower due to the XT drama!"" you say. That is not necessarily true. The Finex cascade ran so many stops and caused so much panic selling that if those traders and holders come to their senses and want back in, they must buy back, and do so in a market that has been stripped of sellers. The longer the market sits steady at this price, the more price will edge higher as this happens.If you were waiting for sub $200, that was your chance. With these buying opportunities comes low sentiment (which is why everyone wants to wait for lower prices that won't come) and they tend to last for days rather than weeks with the opportunity for really cheap coins (at the apex of the crash) lasting for minutes or hours. That is where the biggest traders build positions, during the big sell climaxes, but it is hidden to the public who are distracted with scary red bars.The longer we stay in this range with $200-$220 as a bottom the less chance we will go below. This is because of the effect supply absorption has on the market--it prevents it from making new lows and quality absorption causes higher lows and declining trade volume--the market eventually becomes dull as selling and trading grind to a halt. Because of this activity I see on the charts, I'm a buyer at $225 every time.That leaves the average investor in a conundrum. Buy now or wait for lower prices that are not guaranteed? Obviously during the past down cycle waiting would have been prudent, but what if the price had gone into a new bubble May/June 2014? It totally could have but it didn't. What if Gox hadn't failed? Everyone who waited would be stuck buying back at higher prices. So where in the cycle do you buy? For the prudent investor it is not during a bull market. Instead he watches for the market to bottom out and give evidence of accumulation. There are technical ways to predict bottoms but they are not well known, (and TA gets dismissed as voodoo around here anyway  )No problem sitting out when the price is above 150+. May start buying it if drop below 150 and will definitely buy at below 100.I have brought some Bitcoins in these few days of crash so far my investment is looking good and I think that I will make a decent profit off it if the prices rise again. So till then I am hodling my Bitcoins and advice all members also to do so. There is no doubt that this is golden time for buying Bitcoins.Price can go even little bit more down but all this is temporary and there will be seen a sudden price rise too in coming days.This is opportunity to make an entry point into Bitcoin's universe.In all honesty, if Bitcoin drops below 100 I think it would be time to jump ship. No way the price could organically drop that low unless some event took place that spelt out doomsday for Bitcoin. Buying cheap is good, but if the price gets low enough it's also a good sign that the moon is not to be achieved.You seem pretty experienced and I enjoyed reading your post and like your rationale. I hope you're right too man. So you don't think we'll dip below 200 because of the XT controversy? I bought at 222 recently...tried for 205 but the price was rebounding so quickly that it shot up to 222 by the time I could confirm my buy. Since last night I noticed some whale traders on Finex are slowly buying back in to not put the price up too much. Long futures contracts are also being accumulated and making higher lows since yesterday. And there's a lot of buy activity on Bitstamp where you generally see more public buying/selling (due to their large European customer base and lack of advanced trading features--it's a pretty basic exchange in that regard).I think $210-225 has been an attractive price for some time, so this creates a demand floor. Of course I don't know where the bottom is--a good trader will play the probabilities but change position on a dime if need be. Some bears are convinced that this entire bubble from $20 will eventually unravel but I think people like Bitcoin too much for that to happen Thanks man--There is definite method to a market's madness if you know what you are looking for.I'm personally 'out of the game' as someone who took my position in an earlier generation.; I'm mostly just trying to give an honest appraisal of how I would be reading the card deck now.; I could be wrong...I often am.What could also happen, however, is that a hostile takeover event (such as XT was) could succeed and could ruin Bitcoin as a viable value basis and settlement layer for a system of subordinate chains such as sidechains.; In that case it would be a simple matter for the subordinate chains system to choose something else and something better.; We (hodlers) would have to hope that whatever that something else was, it derived at least some of it's initial its value from the Bitcoin blockchain.; That is actually quite possible.If sidechains come to the fore, the sum total of all sidechains will be reflected in Bitcoin.; Certainly some sidechains will fail and some will be scams and so on, but sitting on the actual value store in the form of Bitcoin will be effectively having a simultaneous bet on all of them and could potentially be a 'dynastic wealth' event.By my estimation, there is a higher chance that 2015 accumulation will result in a payday than the late 2011 opportunity when I did my accumulation.; I judge the likelihood of losing all ones money to be pretty high in 2015 just as I did in 2011 though so it's always good advice to never sink money into anything so speculative if one cannot walk away from it with a laugh.I am persistent in ""fighting the good fight"" as you've previously mentioned and my confidence in BTC is somewhat unshakeable but I didn't get the chance to hop in so early and the bag is getting pretty heavy; I sure hope you're right.So about 90% I am sure that this is a good and fair price to get into Bitcoin game. I leave those 10% just in case since with Bitcoin you never really know, especially because of this XT turmoil. So 10% that we might see much cheaper coins in the near future, up to $150.One can argue that these are some great prices to get in and they should be. There is a huge resistance in this $200-$220 area. Every time that we even dipped into this area, we have bounced back very strongly. "
4200,1157727analyzed.txt,2015/8/21,"The only thing that can eventually eclipse the Bitcoin is Ethereum. Right now it's the only possible case, but with low chances, we won't see another Bitcoin bubble.I agree man...when the price dips below 220 and gets close to 200 I can't help but buy a chunk. I think a lot of people are the same way and that's why when we dip below 200 or even approach it the price boomerangs back up by about 30 bucks. What are the signals of a market bottom aside from a flash crash, super high volume, and then a boomerang in price? Just curious . I say the exact opposite will happen. We will see several bubbles in the future.It's just a question how huge this bubbles will be.And what do you mean that we won't see another bubble?That's a very speculative assumption and will have to be proven in the future. Ethereum also can be one of the greatest failures in Altcoin history.Buying bitcoin is something I do regularly. Not a lot each time. 0.2 btc to 0.5 btc each time. Still loosing money now, will be laughing when price is over $500 next year.People should be buying whole bitcoins at this point...only a matter of time until very few will be able to afford to buy an entire bitcoin at once. Same thing I do. But I might buy a big amount sometime soon and leave it until next year.Rule #1 of trading, take everything with a grain (or two) of salt. Sorry to hear that though.I was told the same thing when the price was > $1000, went all-in And the other #1 rule, dont listen to any ""advice"" given on this forum, especially in this subforum...well dont listen to 99% of it, some do give thoughtful and thorough market commentary.long term is all that matters. as long as you don't sell, you don't lose. people then will regret not having used this price decline in their advantage.You shouldn't have listened to those people...you bought at the top of a bull run.

But everyone's a prediction hero until they're suddenly... not. Doing TA in crypto is more gambling than really knowing or predicting.Exactly this. Furthermore I don't like guys who claim to be self-centered smart asses.BTW nice work and hope you will also get lucky next time. There are a million people in crypto and at the end of the month if someone's prediction comes true then we see these kinds of posts. just a lucky guess, nothing to see here."
4206,1158321analyzed.txt,2015/8/21,"Yes, I never abandon the hope.Since the price could suddenly drop to the seabed, of course, it also can suddenly rise to the Moon.I am not sure the end of the month of August will be $300 too difficult. maybe if the end of the year I believe; i believe in anything is possible with bitcoin.if price can drop drastically in just a matter of week, it can also happen with price increasethat's not going to happen. chances are higher to see the price go down. let's first try to build up level for level before dreaming of $300.I think we can reach to $300 after issue bitcoin XT does not affect to bitcoin price and i hear bitcoin XT have trojan virus and ip tracked.Ye ye, they said the same about litecoin, that it was dead and bla bla, you know speculators and their shit. Suddenly in a matter of days it went from 1 dollar to 8 and even now that dropped its still 3,5x of the original price when everyone was saying that it was deadNothing to worry about here guys...these are just growing pains.It's very unlikely to see that price in the following 9 days.We can be lucky if we see $300 until the end of this year to be honest.We are going through tough times at the moment. Bitcoin XT has no role to Play in this sudden Rise and downfall for this Price. ---Edit---I am Optimistic so will hope it should Rise , even though its very difficult. Nearly difficult but not Impossible , even price went 160$ two days back. If the Fork is relaxed then it might happen , it also require a lot of Investment in Bitcoins , The sudden Drop was because some Crazy Guy dumped his Bitcoins for Lazy Money leading to Crash of BTC/$.;Wow such logic!!!; Since an earthquake can suddenly knock down a building, of course, it can also suddenly build one!!!; ;Maybe if the block drama settles down.litecoin was heavily manipulated by a group of wealthy traders. from $1 to $8 in a few days isn't exactly a healthy rise. great for litecoin holders as they can sell.It doesn't look as though it will settle down quickly.; So it can be a dump before a very big pump. The bitcoin XT is the main reason behind it, or maybe the whales are eliminating the small time bitcoiners from the market so that they will have full control of the swing. According to me, this price limit can't even reach till the end of this year. As i said it was stable at 3-4$ and it stil is so i would say it's healthy, what does it matter how it got pumped? Arent all cryptos being pumped just because of speculation.No way my man. Trust me that everyone is waiting on the XT situation to settle and especially some big investor that would have to drop that kind of money to push it to the $300. Nothing major will happen until the XT situation doesn't get resolved. "
4207,1158321analyzed.txt,2015/8/22,"And if we don't take profit off this opportunity then we are dumb.So we have got enough time to fill our pockets with bitcoins.And that time will be around january,2016.to me it does matter. i prefer a stable growth that lasts much longer over a short peak that at some point will vanish to ultra low levels. long term is what i am looking for.price still kept dropping until today tho i think its hard to pump dat price thoit wont reach 300$; (i'm sorry if im offensive )well this isn't really harsh I too think that the price of bitcoin wont reach 300 for a month or so but I'm still holding Whether it will reach 300 by the end of August I doubt it unless the world economy goes down more and people start looking at other options.For once both Bitcoin and the stock exchanges are in sync as they tend to be counter cyclical. http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/08/20/stock-market-pain-spreads/32047401/Well with the world economy and US stock exchanges dropping 5 to 7 % this week That's almost a dream for now. I don't see any improvement about XT-Core block size debate. There's no reason to go up 300$ until the end of this month.yeah , that made my daybitcoin have virusI think correct, even by end of this year reaching 300 may be difficult. If some bad news about XT-code then it may reach to 300 but not end of this month may be end of this year."
4208,1158321analyzed.txt,2015/8/23,"and i think the bitcoin price will only reach $250 in the end of august lateri'm still believe the bitcoin price will rise again soon but to reach $300 in the end of august i'm pretty doubt about ithmm could rise slightly to $250, but according to my predictions will tend to be stable or decreasing in price of $230-240.Predictions based on what, if i may ask? There is no way to predict cryptocoins price, it\xb4s never stable, maybe \xb4\xb4stable\xb4\xb4 for a month or two and then boom, 100$ changes in price, that\xb4s what you call stable? Look at the bitcoin chart through the years, it has never been stable for more than 1 month or 2 at most, there is no way to predict anything right now, not until more people start using it and more entities start adopting it, until then the price can go up or down simply because of speculation without any real reason.*This is only my prediction is based on several months backward; I only predict a few months backward, when the bitcoin prices stable in price $220, then increased slowly to price $270, then down again to the price $220, and the previous month bitcoin rises again reached the highest price $255 and now down again to the price $235. and this possibility will also go down again and stable in price $220.I think even prices may go down to around 200 by looking at last few days trade. Now a days prices are not moving up and mostly less than 228 to 235 range. yeah I also predict the price will go down, but I do not think will be $200, but if it touched $200, the price will quickly rise back to $220 or more No rising is not easily ....Dropping is due of scar but rising is due of what ?Looking at how the chart is panning out, the 'random walk' could do it by end of year (not a prediction), but end of month is looking increasingly unlikely.+1 on lack of sense for the logic... TP- The XT adoption has been the main catalyst of the price decline (aside from the sell off last week) and nothing indicates it has been resolved. Why would the price suddenly shoot up 70$ in 9 days? What on earth makes you think that aside from blind faith? Greece's latest referendum may help the price IF the radical left wins (which it probably won't given that the special election was called for by the opposing faction) and possibly the fed's rate hike in September may help the price IF they do in fact hike the rates (although this has already been factored into the precious metals market). But these are all huge IFs and they won't necessarily move the price. I wish it would hit 300$ by the end of August, but you're dreaming if you actually think it will. Ehm? I asked you what do you base your predictions on, are they just simply guesses? Or are you using anything to estimate those prices? Saying the price will go down/up doesn\xb4t mean you predicted anything even if it does, it could be simply luck, most likely it is.Previously, all dreamed of in 1000$, is now waiting for 300$ more in the time we wait for 200$.Core/xt guys need to ""talk"".i think...we will stay (fluctuating) between 220 - 240 @ september/october,the most important is to be stable not to reach 300; technical stats tell that we will see something around 200It is hard to predict the price at the end of this month where it will be but one thing is sure price will rise again over 300$ very soon again.After the whales playing with small investors will be finished and that can be tomorrow or any day.It is matter of hours to take the up if whales want to do so.Goin by the chart: It's going to fall below $210 by the end of August and this downtime will remain till September.People said ""$1000 @end of year"" in 2014... and here we stay, we are rich$231 end august You are right at the moment we need to see some stability in prices.Indicators are not showing it to be at 300$ till the end of August.It will be there but on long term not in short term."
4209,1158321analyzed.txt,2015/8/24,"impossible is nothing.According to me it is impossible to achieve $300 at end of August. But there are only 7 days or so left in August and let's say Bitcoin have to move up around $10 each day. hmmm, very positive. ~~maybe next monthanything is possible with bitcoin nowadays but the chance is getting lower and lower. we are all going down, please use your brain to get us out of this situation...why do you even post here? Are you getting satoshis for senseless posts?...Bla,bla,bla, maybe next month...Well in 1 day it had a change of around 40$ so it would definitely be possible but i doubt it as well unless something big happens that affects bitcoin i don\xb4t see it going more than 250, maybe litecoin could rise a little bit more than bitcoin with the halvening coming tomorrow but i doubt it will happen this month."

Let\xb4s be honest here, your predictions like everyone else\xb4s predictions are bullshit because no one can predict the bitcoin price, maybe they were right but hey that could happen to anyone.but i predict that at the end of august 2015 the price will be around 180$..We know our predictions are not going to change anything ..The big whales are buying now from all the panic sellers; and now its the best time to buy.I dont think so. Althogh the price is very low now, I think its the bottom and we will not see the btc price under 200$.yes indeed no one can predict bitcoin, but at least I can predict it to trade.this is only a prediction, I already told you that this is only a prediction, so it can go wrong and true.we trust it, it can be realprice move on from 200 to 220 i trust that very easy to up 300$ again  Don't trust, just trade.

4211,1158321analyzed.txt,2015/8/26,"although anything is possible with bitcoin, but right now the possibility of price going down is higher that it going up.it doesn't look like a possibility to me, there is nothing going on that can push the price up to $300 in 4-5 days ahead until the end of August. Anyway I learned a valuable lesson after the recent drop, If i am not wrong btc price can't go below 200-180$ for a long time. If it does, bitcoin will collapse. People said 40.000$ at the end of 2015 in 2013, yet here we are 221$; I couldn't care less if Bitcoin goes 100 dollars next month, that just means more Bitcoin for me since I buy it monthly, and god knows if the signature guys have the decency to up the rates if the price goes ridiculously low. If you are here to hold for a decade like me, then you will embrace periods of low price, because it means whales selling and wealth redistributing.Im rallyholic, if we see 300$ the rally will startWe have already start you will see end of this month price will reach to $300. Bitcoin always get big issue but still can survive well, it can already start with getting the 20% it lost in the last month, but go to 300$ in less of a week sounds a challenge.Looking at the graphs with regard to the last two years, a clear downwards trend is reconized.. Something should change. Although I do not loose my hope too . That will be a huge challenge indeed. And, to my knowledge, nothing really indicates that we are going to reach such levels within a week. I seems like 200$ is a reasonable mid range for the rest of 2015. 300 for 2016 would seem more reasonable. Too much instability with the fork newsYeah, Moon is always a option, but with markets crashing hard will be hard for BTC to rise right now. I think it will rise in a couple of moths. "

No one is interesting it any more ... The project is failed and no one any effort for revive it .... more Disadvantages discover every day ...... Mining is not profitable any more ...... the market is on control of some big companies and so on .... I am sure that at the end of August the price will not be 300 us dollar. I am sure even about another thing: No one can find the price of bitcoin in every moment he want to try or to predict. The price cannot be founded. If yes there must be to many billionaires today because of this gift of nature.So nobody can be sure, but you are sure it won't be $300?moving on...oh well...; he he somebody is taking the whole prediction methodology kinda the wrong way.Well!! will see downtrend will coming or not. IMO when price get broke below $120 in end of this month. No hope for bitcoin up but when we reach $250 bitcoin will to the moon  hope so!!Only 5 days to September and looking at the sell and buy orders in exchanges we would need a decent pump to break the pre 300 walls, but who knows, nowadays in one day a lot of things can happen.hmm a decent pump is putting it lightly lol going upwards is much hard than going downwards lol for bitcoin pricesI hope 300 by end of August.

The OP made a prediction that failed. I don't think anyone can accurately predict Bitcoin's price, but if the OP had got lucky and made a correct prediction he would be claiming he could predict the price, and using this thread as evidence. I think that $300 seemed a bit optimistic. Maybe at the end of September it could hit $250 which is more likely than $300. we must hold bitcoin and waiting good price to sell it may be end of september will be 300$ look end of august only at 227$ If not, then probably go back to mid 200ish if not being 300. I only see the august price if we can hold or last $200ish for the 3rd week."

I could swear too that the last 300 rise was in Augustprobably he meant July.Time.; Gotta hate it Price never hit $300 this August.; You must be thinking last August, because last August it wasn't merely $300, it was $500.I hope so. But i think it's hard to see $300 in several days or weeks. There are some bad news about bitcoin and crimes in August. I hope we can see $300 in December maybe. And for OP, it's already September  so you can change your title.This is very far from your predictions, even today bitcoin prices have not yet reached $ 250, but the hope that good; well unfortunately it was a bad guess i hope it will reach 300 next monthMove the prediction of $300 mark by end of December. Im pretty sure next month btc price won't hit that mark.I think that the price will go steadily up, though. Maybe it will stabilize at around 235 USD or so and gradually climb from then mid to late September.we don't abandon the hope, i think the hope abandon us, this has been a hard year for bitcoin, we need a magical prize bump now.december will be optimistic; people will probably start stashing up for the halving, because it's likely that the price will be pre-pumped way before the actual halving.I actually agree with this. There's no special good enough of a reason for the price to go up 25% from where it is now, and i do also believe thatIt doesn't work that way.; A price rise requires more money moving into Bitcoin. A price fall doesn't."

You will find the price and you will be made rich trading with that price.What do you tell now when we are in September, August is gone and the price of bitcoin did not go at 300 us dollar? Your sophistical sentences didn't told nothing but the title was clear: 300 us dollar at the end of August.Yes rising is very hard ........ dropping just needed a little push .........i don't doubt the fact that we will reach the $300 level. it's just that i think we won't see it this year. every attempt to reach and maintain $300 has failed so far this year. next year block halving will surely give the price a decent boost.is the halfing happening in december?Price will drop to $90 at next year and after halving it back to $130-$150 Range price again ...........Next year, next summer.Don't agree. Price will go at 13 December 125.45 us dollar, then will go 65.87654 at 30 February, then at 47 August will go 1236.8765 us dollar and then finally will be stabilized at 123 452 us dollar exactly at 13:43 of 65 October 2016 and this will be the final price. From that date the price will be stable and will not move never in time.wow those are some very accurate figures there mate lol  hopefully we can get some average figures soon You are god or something like that ? ............. if you are be right So i am a millioner with having 10 BTC ?"
4218,1158321analyzed.txt,2015/9/5,"People change their predicting tread according the market mood direction. If prices start falling then every one starts saying prices may go to less then 50$.

Looking through your post history, I can't help but be impressed. And the rest of you...Sure mate. You can accumulate not more than 10 btc (because more mean that the price may go to much down) and you the day of judgement will be very rich. You can go to see the movie with part of that money and maybe can allow yourself to buy even corners to enjoy more the movie. Then with the other money you can do all what you want except going with the bad girls....I don't like bad girls either. Can I go with good girls who do bad things?It was a failed prediction but it's not that bad, just look at the positive side and think that the lower the Bitcoin price is for the longer period of time the more you can make. It's all about making BTC when it's cheap, because it's inevitable that it will eventually go 10k+, I dont care if it takes 1 or 3 halvings, it will, it's a fact just like 2+2=4, if you fail to see this then you are doing it wrong."
4219,1158321analyzed.txt,2015/9/8,The price is going up now. But I believe its the best time to sell because we will see downtrend in the next days

So I think it may reach around 300 range soon but some bad news comes out again about bitcoin prices then this time I feel prices may go below 200. But as of now according to me it is good to hold on btc or accumulate small quantities whenever possible.not really see price strong and look didnt want moved down, keep hold your coins. dont sell it in cheap pricei think badnews will come if bitcoin price hit 300$Bitcoins market is very vast you can keep accumulating in small quantities when ever you see selling pressure,; that is the right time when the market is in correction mode. As per my trading view is that you should accumulate when ever the market crashes and sell when you feel that it is gone to peak high and correction is needed.how long will people continue to accumulate? the price is well below $300 for quite some time now, which means they have had plenty of time to buy the desired amount of coins already.Can confirm we have hit the bottom.However, i do believe that we will see this price again soon. In fact, with the halving coming next year and with more and more people using BTC the demand will simply start to increase. (Let's hope so)It was a bummer for me since I thought the price would become stable above the $300 mark.I believe the end of September bitcoin will reach $300 and you have to change the title "" $300 in the end of September ""Agreed. Whenever I'm disappointed about where the price currently is I just tell myself, well, I can accumulate that many more bitcoins. I never dreamt I'd have the amount I have thanks to this huge bear market. And as long as new big wave of new buyers coming in this game of buying and selling will continue without much prize movement.So be patient and hope the best for the future or leave if you can not handle it I would say.It's not just accumulating. Many guys also just trade. Buying and selling. Buying on the way down and expected bottom and selling on the way up and at expected peak.I think many people are disheartened because they compare these prices to the $1200 bubble which was completely fake, manipulated, and unreal. It makes today's prices seem like bitcoin is going to die in their minds, but in reality, these are much more normal prices in my mind. Surely, it wasn't all Willy and Markus, but they worked synergistically with people panic buying and the Chinese buying like crazy. Then if it won't happen you can try it in October, November and December. Finally you'll see Bitcoin couldn't reach 300$ again in 2015. Wait for 2016.If it doesn't happen by November then it won't this year. I feel like people sell a lot in December for xmas stuff. I think other way round because in December people may use Bitcoin to buy many online items so it will create a demand for coins Good point. Only time will tell .Their should be some reason for Bitcoin moment to run, whether its up or down.You are absolutely right in December we can expect the price above 300$+ as mostly all of them who ever have accumulated Bitcoins in low will try to cash out in gift, purchase mode. But their should also be good sites who accept Bitcoin Payments. Only; when the mostl of the famous online Sites start business with Bitcoins, till then you cannot see heavy moment inBitcoins, you can see just 10 or 20 % up or down.August is ended and we are at price $230 ....

People aren't moving into bitcoin for safety.The USD won't keep rallying forever either. I'm of the opinion that there will be no true safe haven, in the event of another economic collapse. That's why it's best to diversify.What has amazed me lately is Warren Buffets investment in trains at a time(2-3 years ago) that pipelines where looking to take over. Flash forward to today and trains are moving more oil than ever before. Little off topic but interesting he saw this coming or was positioned well enough to take advantage.This is similar to how China is manipulating its own currency,just not as obvious to the every day person.The USD is inflated through oil being pulled out of the ground at a unheard of rate. This will not be able to continue long term and should please the Saudis at the end of the day.Yes but we must also take into account the impact of the blocksize issue on Bitcoin. If anything the stock market crash may have slowed down a crash in Bitcoin over the blocksize issue.

But it can get hyped with some new and make indicators wrongHere's a chart to try and get things going. We've been trading in an obvious range since the crash. I am bullish bc of the fact that we have been trading towards the top of the range so my chart leads to me believe we will go back to the breakdown point around 250 shortly. I'd like to see this thread stay alive. Wall observer thread is now garbage. p.p.s. just remember it could always be worse. You could have been invested in the DOW!

I expect the price to be within the range from approximately 220 to 300 for the next months, perhaps a year or more, but at least until the end of summer.I think we are in for a price discovery of the bottom in the next 6-12 months. Price will tend towards the mining cost (which I calculate at roughly 150 per coin at the moment) plus the monetary (or speculatory) premium for holding this asset.acutally... wasn't really even close; as depicted below:hmmm, looks much like a microcosm of my longer term ""sideways all summer"" movement; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^i think mining cost include the miner-roi would be more than 150 usd, 200-230 ;usd is more likely. so todays price; 233 is just about right//though you do not account for the monetary premium (or perhaps you deem the monetary value to be 0)your numbers seem reasonable.

When it hugs the top resistance like that without supply to break it down, eventually it will find its way through. I'm cautiously bullish only because the Bears have gone home. Their side of the auction room is a bit messy with kicked chairs, spilled drinks and a couple of passed out hookers, but now it is mostly empty and their potential selling power is out of the market. The only people left selling are the laggards wanting to cash out over the XT drama and retail traders shorting into what might be an epic bear trap. (leave it to them to build up shorts at every bottom, every time)There isn't exactly a lot of buying either ......... if the support will break we will see price $170I thoroughly believe for Bitcoin 15 M chart candle never work ..... just try on daily or 4H chart and it says bitcoin growing up to 250-270 again like as you said .....At some point it's simply cheaper to profit from pumping rather than risking a dump where nobody follows you down. One must look which side has the most pull and profit potential left. If I was a whale, that big short was a test. Breaking lower support on high volume would tell me if there was any meaningful supply left down there. But it held, and on lower volume. That's true. Maybe we get a retest or pullback at in a day or two. Volume will be low so I wouldn't expect it to break. Everyone who was going to sell already did--this goes back to January--causing a supply shortage where one sees characteristic higher lows/higher highs and declining volume as supply absorption plays out over many months. We briefly broke below the 230 support recently.So far, the wall on Bitfinex at 220 is holding.Little pump on CNY/BTC, down to a slight correction now.1450 breached again on CNY/BTC.We need to get to 240 or things might get even uglier here soon.

They would also have to be a bit daffy not to have pulled some money out when prices were higher.

A biological cryptolocker that spreads through a variety of fast food and coffee outlets and kills you within 48 hours unless you cough up would do the job nicely. Then once you've paid up it's revealed that you've only bought yourself another 48 hours. If we have those two things, then we could see that huge green candle you are looking for.

He's familiar with bitcoin but he's not on board with it. He seemed to know the basics about it (you know the stuff you hear on mainstream media). I had a family get together yesterday, I was talking to my older brother who's a comp-sci major and he programs for a living. You would need something that would create a large demand for the currency for that to happen. Too easy to pirate surely. You want Apple bringing out the iphone 21 and suddenly demanding that they'll only take BTC for it. Total commercial suicide but a fun idea. Maybe someone like Lady Gaga or other big pop-star having an exclusive bitcoin album? You can only get it if you pay with bitcoin sorta deal. haha, I could see that as a sci-fi movie.

Amazon is a big deal. The bull run may not last very long but it surely will generate a huge load of volume.If Amazon really thought it through properly they could offer modest discounts and it could open up markets for them that aren't presently plugged into the credit or debit card system but there doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm. I don't see it myself. There would still be zero incentive for your average shopper to make use of it. The Bitcoin price is going to blow up because institutional investors will want to hold it as a commodity to hedge against the fiat market and as a speculative instrument. It's not gonna happen because some corporation decides they will integrate Bitcoin to their payment processing option and then sell them on the market straight for fiat. This also means stop looking for the ""killer app"" that will somehow bring Bitcoin to the masses. It might be the case that eventually Bitcoin will be abstracted down to the public and create and actual use case for the retail/commercial segment but we are still a couple years away from this. As is stands Bitcoin is quite simply an absurd proposition from a consumer standpoint except for certain niche casesNo amount of retail adoption is going to ""massively move the market"". You people need to think outside the box for a second and forget about the delusional blatter that Bitcoin is somehow so much better for online commerce than credit cards. That is simply not true. Average joes are perfectly comfortable shopping using credit cards and there is barely any incentive that would entice them to change these spending habit. The idea that ""Amazon accepts Bitcoin therefore everyone should want to shop there using Bitcoin"" is asinine. This. As there is no incentive by itself to use bitcoins (for average consumers), and certainly not with such variable prices I think the only way bitcoin would be adopted is if the value of it would constantly slowly increase. that would be it's killer app. Unfortunately so far the necessary momentum to start such a process is still missing.too much people are waiting for a huge peak at this point. an investment to pay off takes time. i don't think much can make the price go up significantly at this point. i hope for a stable but steady year by year growth instead of a large peak.I don't think it's asinine to think Amazon adopting bitcoin will drive the price up, at least for a few hours. I just don't think it will be a huge deal, and I think price will come down lower, eventually. In the past, we've had tigerdirect, overstock, newegg, microsoft, etc, adopting bitcoin as a form of payment; at the time of announcement, bitcoin price would zoom up, but then reality sets in, these companies are converting btc into fiat as soon as they receive bitcoins, meaning they are dumping btc and driving the price lower. In that sense, it's asinine to believe that the merchant adoption will drive the price to the moon. Tl;dr, merchant adoption alone will not drive the price to the moon...we were older? Then we wouldn't have to wait so long.Stock markets crash. Or some country announcing to accept Bitcoin as a nation wide currency. It must be a huge event that's for sure."

I used to have a nagging background worry about a collapse in the world banking system, bank accounts just being digits etc. Since owning some bitcoin, yes it goes up and down a lot, but you've always got the same digits tomorrow as you have today, doesn't matter how many insane cocaine addicted bankers are messing around with their TBTF system. It's a very relaxing hedge to have. I am actually very surprised more people don't own a few. It might flash crash below $100 but I think we're getting close to the bottom. Bitcoin do not need high prices to be successful. I don't mind which price range, just be stable so merchants can price there product in bitcoin without the need to change it every few days.Stable range is only possible when speculators are replaced by investors. Because poople would stop looking at price only. ;Speculators would leave the market and coins would be distributed more evenly... Hoping this is good, but it will remain this much probably just till January 2016, when the XT drama will be over. I think it'll be over before then. There's a conference regarding scaling next month involving plenty of developers and a lot of the big players have come out in support of larger blocks. We'll likely know whether XT continues to grow as well. There's a strong possibility it'll tail off over the coming weeks. "

Merchants can convert what they received into fiat, as long as we have about the same amount of coins bought by users to spend, we can achieve equilibrium and price stability.Investors are speculators; People will start to lose interest, and find other things to do. bitcoin will die. Then how will bitcoin ever grow? People will keep holding their coins thinking the price will rise but when it won't they'll just sell it and leave the bitcoin world for good. Currently, people love bitcoins as they hope to earn profit when the price reaches $1000 like 2 years ago but $200-$300 is not worth their wait.Also, bitcoin won't grow if it's stable & might make everyone bored and out from bitcoin world Bitcoin price often drops if it's stable for a long time, so it's better to increase even a little.Bitcoin block halving is near, so miners will be selling their bitcoins in a high price and the price will tend to increase. No, it isn't possible. I believe what the OP wants is ALL OTHER speculators to leave the market soon (before the halving), and come back after the halving, to hold his bag. Speculators are the main force behind this market. If they all leave then the price could drop (eventually) to single digits.Speculation, drugs, commerce. That's likely to be the order of who's in this market and speculation verily dwarfs everything else by a country mile. If that goes then you'll have the exceptionally stable price of absolutely fuck all. The first argument (of Bitcoin) is, because ... law in my country can freeze and stealth life economies in a bank account.Right for the second place of i'm choosed to store life econmies."

It has never experienced a global economic crisis. Surviving its first global economic crisis will be far more important than anything else in its history. It will be more important than dollar parity, the pizza transactions, or the bubbles. If bitcoin survives the next economic crisis, then it is will no longer be an experiment. It will be a bona fide store of value. But before that, there will be truly horrific lows. 2011's drop from $30 -> $2 is seen as the ultimate drop that can never be surpassed. I question that assumption.Looking like 40BTC a minute coming into to China atm w/ a tad coming from the EU and USA, tho it's night in both places. China seems to be accelerating the purchasing, however. Price has been trending up slightly at this point so with a new week starting, we shall see what direction China wants to go.

4253,1160374analyzed.txt,2015/8/24,"today the price of btc is 1btc=$222 .. do you think guys what is the lowest rate of btc will become before it goes up again? and reason...Personally I still think we will get a nice boost to 400-500 though. The bears are becoming more active again. Some even say we can go as low as low 100 or even double digits before the end of the year.Based on whats been happening this past week, probably further down. Long term though BTC is looking to go up again, since the downtrend is slowing slightly.So watch out before buying. I don't believe in very long term plans for bitcoins because after falling from 1000+ never looks prices ever ready to reach around 500 range. Its been already more than a year. I think in next couple of months btc will be going down slowly and it may go back to around 150 range. Now the whole btc sentiment is very negative until some good news come out on btc prices doesn't look like will go up. I feel now just wait and watch for some time before even start averaging it. This is very uncertain situation and unfortunately indicators are not in favor of buying at this moment.We can see further down fall of price till 200$ and I don't think it will be under this price.In short period of time no sign to see rises in price.Positive thing is downtrend has slowed down.That's just wishful thinking. We are still sliding down the 'classic' 3-5% per day :/So ready for lower prices .........I am really afraid to say it could never go up again ..... the trend is Descending for long time ......... there is no lowest price at Downtrend ....... for going up we need see resistance $700-850 again .... going up is Heavily depend on news .......... in future what will happen ? no one knowsat this point the bottom is $200 so it is possible to see it trying to go below that. support there seems to be fairly strong, but you never know. a large dump can get things down quickly.DenisI'm hoping I'm wrong. Well, more specifically, I'm hoping it hits $200, I get a bunch of S5s for $100 each, and then it rebounds to a bajillion dollars a BTC. Wishful thinking...I know my cut-off point is at $180. At that point, even with my cheap power and my paid off S5s, there's no way I could continue mining. I may let it go a bit longer (at a loss) to support the process, but it's something I don't see being sustainable as a miner (for me anyway). My fear is that we're getting to a point, likely sub-$200, where BTC isn't viable to mine even with very efficient ASICs and cheap power. I fear we're coming to a point where the big mining ops in China are going to start cutting capacity, making the confirmations on exchanges longer (because of less available mining capacity). The good news is this will cause a lot of the mid size and smaller players to cash out their equipment, so you can get some decent rigs for next to nothing. The bad news is that these kind of things typically take a long time to rebound, if they do.JoustRegards,It will go down to about 150-180 dollar per bitcoin after that we will see a boost that will bring bitcoin upto 350+ dollar per bitcoin, I will expect that in the end of this year or start of 2016.It seems that it will go down under 200$ and then will rise for 300$ plus in couple of months.At this moment there is no buy support/demand so more and more adoption and accessible price for everyone.Bitcoin needs price stability.hi. do you have any basis that it will really go down to 150-180? are you really sure about this? and how accurate do you think is your speculation? can you share us? thanksWhat the issue coming up can make price drop fast again. Anyone know what the reason price drop. i need who good in prediction if he/she say price drop i will sell my bitcoinI dont know why, but i think it because btc always goes down a bit and then rises again, if u look at weekly charts. I think it is mayby 20$ edge of my speculation, so it could be high 100(170-190).Nobody really knows how low btc will go. One thing's for certain, btc always does the opposite of what everyone's expecting. So, btc TO DA MOON!!!Tbh both things could happen, if we did drop its a great chance to shoot up again.; The whales control the price and are going to want decent returns when they push the market back up."

There has not yet been a bankruptcy case where anything but money was returned in Japan. However they sell those 200 k bitcoins it's unlikely to result in a price pump.He might be waiting for the Gox coins to be dealt with, which will probably be before January.If you look at the last lowest price it was actually 154, so as long as we keep away from that number we are up. Of course I expect a big turmoil starting September with the big ass stress test (basically an attack to push the blocksize agenda). Interesting times indeed.BTC started from 1 penny to $1200 so the lowest price is 1 penny ...... Reason : if Btc project will failed (at least in mind of people ) we will back to the start point ...... and in mind of most people it is happeningTime to sell ... sell now and will not be regret at 2016/2017Be rich in 2016 ? the markets are extremely bearish atm so we aren't going to see any particularly high rallies soon lol 222 is a good price to be at atm ;;Like you said we have a strong wall in range price 190-200. and now we will start up and up and january price will reach to $400.

I'm here for the long haul.Yes, it will reach SEVERAL new highs.No way I can expect Bitcoin to reach $10K and $100K that easily, there must be blood in the streets and to be honest, I'm happy about it, because in this investment, the strong who REALLY DESERVE TO WIN.But most of the community doesn't understand that Bitcoin is a high risk/high reward business/invest whatsoever.If REALLY people see it like this, they have all my respect.Your comment betrays an ignorance of how bitcoin works and why it is worth using. It won't just ""die"", it can't, by design.What if a comet lands on my head.My friend, people like these don't deserve to throw away your precious time and effort to write a reply for, there is an awesome clickable button under any username called ""ignore"", click it and you will pray for me Na, that button is reserved for blatant trollery (and certain obnoxious cases). If it really is honest ignorance at work here, then edumacating him might just be worth it. Remember, other people read this.Good point of view, respect.Get some fiat ready. It won't be long until there is a final wash-out period to wash out all of these weak hands. i think those ""weak hands"" are dumping on purpose to buy lower, they are simply taking advantage of the split drama, i would not call them naive users or weak hands...Yea this is just a manipulation to drop the price due to the split uncertainty. Things will be going up as soon as Gemini announces their start date. Weak hands are long gone. Have been for months. This is something else.strong hands folding into even stronger hands?Sure, it's all relative. But you won't convince me that an elephant is a small creature just because a sperm whale is bigger.Now the greater fools will tell everyone to man up until they are destroyed together.The real men sold at $315 as I advised them to one month in advance.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1082909.msg12231455#msg12231455It will get MUCH worse:I appreciate to be a fool than to be blind-guided and taking an economist as my prophet/God. I'm sorry pal, I'm not a sheep.so get your shit straight and tell them egomaniac forkers to gtfo of bitcoin! starting with them two usg moles gavin and hearn.thats why its price is stalling now. you cant have both an investment and pocket money. by definition it is not the same. otherwise it will just be a pale copy of visa/mastercard/paypal and it will sink, because it simply cant compete.so bitcoin is bound not to be free to transact with. nevermind, just HODL ffs!it is a Privilege, as in the privilege of securing your wealth from the banksters and bypass them!but hopefully, not like the euro, bitcoin is an investment! not cash, not pocket money!for example, just look at what them politicians are doing with the euro and greece! they rightfully fear to create that precedent of exiting that stinky zone!the rules should be set in stone, and not subject to any major modification and by anyone, or that would create a precedent. but for now, gavin et al had exactly what they wanted, that is dividing the community and induce fear that it is not such a good investment.i do hope its antifragility would make bitcoin rise up from xt's hashes.that is so wrong on so many levels and in total opposition with bitcoin's fundamentals.why always this urge of Quantitative Easing everything? it is its robustness against human miscalculations, its decentralization, its permission-less-ness and its network's security that matters.i mean fuck look at the damned financial markets all around the world that are on the edge of a massive collapse! but it's its scarcity both in cap and transaction that will allow it to surpass any regular investment. people are too much anticipating, buying the fake dreams of them antonopoulos, gavin et al, saving the planet with free insta-frappucinos.but it is so not going to happen anyway, even if you ""scale it"" in advance. sry people wake up. mass adoption will not improve bitcoin's store of value, it is quite the opposite actually, it will flood and drown it. thing is, people seems not to grasp the complexity of the matter: it is indeed highly political.it is its robustness against human miscalculations, its decentralization, its permission-less-ness and its security that matters.regardless of which, I think bitcoin is here to stay. didnt he also say he doesnt believe in bitcoins or something lol. Or he just doesnt invest in something he doesnt understand, which is why he stated ""he doesnt believe in bitcoin"".despite those awesome words from warren buffet.I'm still a man after all. Been buying some bitcoins every week for almost a year now regardless of price. But pardon me if I sold something during $300 these past few weeks to buy more of these cheap coins today. Yes.Well said Sir, +100000The level we see is most are used for gambling so unless the other volume is used for actual commerce then thats a different hurdle. But we already seen ""large volume transaction"", unless you are referring to even greater ones then the gambling transactions.edit: and also you have to let the fee market develop, as it is the future incentive for miners to secure the system. so utlimately, blocks should legitimately be approaching fullness.because thats where the value lies.not like the current financial system, with its terrible foundations.point is you have to let bitcoin as pure and and its core as untouchable as possible.im not arguing about patches, bug fix, or next gen, 2nd/3rd/etc layers solutions, which will come, in due time and with fair testing. we saw spam attacks: https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactionsBlocks should be ten times as big as they need to be on average. Why would anyone with serious money invest if there is doubt that the blockchain can handle the load mere years into the future?Well they can be like crap, I have a ton of money I might as well see how well this goes scenario. Or you got the investor who sees the value and doesnt care for the price and see where it can go. I dont know thats a good question, why would anyone with serious money invest.I think I`ll settle for $100, if it goes to the new low. But I doubt this would happen since most see it recover after the xt comments. I guess I`m not real men, since I didnt sell at that price."

It's because of this:I suspect the real reason of BTC taking the hit lately is due to people selling their coins to buy precious metals.

I disagree. This move to me is about uncertainty in the block size issue going forward.Come on, that uncertainty was out there long ago. Why would it suddenly reflect in prices just NOW?Nah, don't think that's the case as Bitstamp isn't exactly a leading exchange anymore. It's all due to XT. Traders shit their pants by just thinking XT will take over.More like traders capitalising on others shitting their pants. There'll always be something to trade be it XTGavinNSACoin or CoreCrippleBlockstreamCoin. Then why don't I give a shit about XT? This XT drama is a false flag drama. It doesn't hurt bitcoin. You don't lose your coins because of it. It doesn't matter which direction bitcoin takes, in the end you still have your coins. Stop spreading this bullshit XT drama as a reason for the price drop. It's not.If xt drama is bullshit....it still is drama.Markets are irrationalTrue. Also, this question does not have a binary answer. We're probably both right.For you and me, and other people out there the whole XT bullshit doesn't mean anything. But as you know the largest part of the traders a.k.a weak hands are very affraid of anything that can drag the price of Bitcoin down. It's the reality whether you like it or not. Better use this situation in your advantage to buy up some coins.; Went to check the price again today and notice another big hit. It's a bit confusing as the Chinese stock market is down, and Wall Street isn't doing well either. I expecting the price to get out of this slump, but it never occurred to me that people were taking their Bitcoin investments and turning them into precious metals. I can see a lot of people doing this in actuality as the stock market isn't looking good.I think that somehow, the XT vs Core issue has something to do with this hit. It's been on a downtrend since the issue on XT intensifies. Stock markets aren't looking that good also. And also the fact that they arent sure people are willing to see people want to see bitcoin split. Its hitting hard, but I think the main reason is due to the fact where we are almost really near with the ""fork situation"".I think most people are just confused as much as I am with what the effects are eg: slower transaction times, or just no response in the core. Is there any difference after the hardfork or the split is done?"
4265,1161024analyzed.txt,2015/8/25,"as for me, I always feel like it is cheating by bitfinex behind the scenes, XT or other just a reason for it to do.interesting points, but anyone really think so?Do people forget Bitcoin was over $1,000 2 years ago? What is a drop from $300 to $200 compared to $1,100 to $300? the price of silver and gold is not rising. both are fluctuating around where theyve been for the last year more or less. if money was moving into PM en mass we would see an uptick in prices. Happens every Chinese new year and also diwali... people put money into PMs at those times and it is visible in the market effect."
4267,1161124analyzed.txt,2015/8/26,The current struggle within the community and the disagree from developers to solve the scalability problem is pushing the price downdon't look at the current market price as it can go down quite a bit within a day again. we need to get rid of the xt fud first. it will continue for a few more weeks at least i guess.I think it will be more than a few weeks and could last quite some time unfortunately. It needs to get resolved though so we can all move on.
4268,1161124analyzed.txt,2015/8/29,Now i was able to buy some bitcoins at cheap prices.If XT drama wouldn't be here then we would still have been on the 280$ mark but ok changes are good.Blame Gavin for the drop in bitcoin prices.
4269,1161141analyzed.txt,2015/8/24,";So, what are our outlooks?Obviously I want to buy cheap bitcoins. But I don't want it cheap if later it will be worthless.With all of that, bitcoin already lost a third part of it's value. Whats next? (Galaxy note 5 hehehe) Obviously this can't last forever. Actually if the 200's borderline will be broken, all the bitcoin ecosystem will crash.There are too many factors. China in crisis, stock market in crisis. Bitfinex removing orderbook, and no announcement at all on the site. The same bitfinex margin calling, shorting directly the price. People panic selling. Uncertainty and chaos total about the hard fork.Yeah, we`ll have a new wallet to download, etc. But it should be the same way we use the core. Okay, everything but the foolish part. Not up to speed with the stock markets, since I dont have money to begin with there, but the hard fork shouldnt be a huge issue.You know what I say, stay hungry and stay foolish."

These will be interesting and bloody hours upcoming!""Flash-crash"" lowball bids at $132 for now.God why is this so much more exciting than watching it go to $315; Actually the price recovered and is above $200 now, the price should stabilize in the upcoming days. A buy support should be build at $200 since many bought when the price went under $200. yeah it didn't go below $190.. dammit, I should've placed my bid a little higher. fk fk fk fk! that was a golden opportunity..Well I snatched some at $200. That worked too well for me. Next time, don't expect it to go so low because obviously, the market wouldn't permit that at all times. Price is back to where its at 24 hours ago and I hope it stays that way or go higher (please)glad to see distribution in action tho. lol sry you sold so much buddy.It is just matter of time later or sooner price will drop below 200$.Few weeks ago too price dropped around 159$ and then we saw huge up rise and it touched somewhat 314$ .I don't take it something to be worried about if price drops again.In price drops, I'm not worried at all given that I'm in here for the long term. I just see those as an opportunity to grab more for the future. Sell some at peak, buy back in at the lows. Easy bitcoins!When your gut hurts and you can't sleep that is your body telling you it is time to buy:)Or your gut deciding whether it will dip a little bit lower in the coming weeks months and you need to figure out what is the best entry point for the time. Too hard to decide isn't it?  Well I'm happy now that I bought some at $200 range and sold some at $297 a few weeks back. I'm in profit all in all. Problem is that I cannot get myself to sell any bitcoin at any point. I'm trying to get the lowest average buy-in price for when the price goes higher  dropping only in couple hour and then back again to $220 i think this is the time for bitcoin price will jump Also there has been another BIP proposal coming from Jeff Garzik, BIP100. It does have nice support all over the community. This as well might raised price up. We have actually seen a very nice recovery. I too expected that once we break $200 on all major exchanges, that we will go down even harder. I guess there is really a lot of buy support around $200. People see this price as very fair to get into the game. Thats going to be a sight to see, if we see bitcoin barely holding for $100 dollars. And it`ll be def due to the xt news of people panic due to the split. If it does go below $200, what if it goes then below mid $100ish.i don't think we're that lucky to see bitcoin going to around the $100 level. a lot of this panic is based on nothing. panic is leading at this point instead of common sense."

4277,1161207analyzed.txt,2015/8/26,"There seems to be a lot of damage from the past sell offs and the latest one too. It would not surprise me that we go under 200 again.I like this theory .......... the only theory that works on BTC charts is Elliot waves .......i also have biases from MACRO stuff from Martin Armstrong's thread on global capital flows, private assets, gold etc. Basically, BTC will rise well with other asset classes in its category when major global markets start exhibiting weakness.Just thought about what you posted on masterluc's thread about global capital flows. It'll be interesting to see how things play out with bitcoin in relation to Armstrong's/Socrates' 2015.75, the False Move & Phase Transition. This guy has pretty good records on his side..;Good you brought him up, he's one the analysts whose charts and forecasts will appear on this threadDavid Alcindor. True, i keep track of his forecasts as well.[img]http://i.imgur.com/8eRuMBS.png[img]Hold tight in that until Spring 2016, then diversify some into gold and crypto coins (especially mine; ) as they will bottom (<$700 and <$100).You should be selling gold, BTC, and bonds, and buying US dollar and US stocks on this low this week.As I explained in my post in the MA thread today, this is the false move that causes the peak in bonds by Oct. 1.;Any steps to take in the immediate future?From https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1082909.400Just what i feel.Since you are asking about feelings, i feel we're in for a shock. Like RynDiclem said above, the market likes to psin things around so that it's not so obvious. If i were to ask around what is the least likely price of bitcoin to expect in the coming months, i bet a majority (75%) would completely rule out $50 as insanity. If you think about it, that's like Jeffrey Tucker making a forecast of BTC at $1000 and getting scoffed at. Maybe, we're in for an inverse $1175 ATH.""I do believe the market will react to the halving but it will not be at a time most people will expect it to happen. If most people expect something to happen at a certain time then the market will find a way to fool these people, otherwise most people would make easy money which is not how markets play out. ""Yes, I'd agree that many are continually trying to call ""the bottom"" of the long term down trend, and that this might continue to blow up in their faces. And I think that double digits are still ""off the table"" for most. As a big believer in max pain, my take on sentiment is that low $100s or double digits are very much on the table still.Stop loss is not good idea for BTC ...... because the source of price is not central ..... may be your position get closed but the market never seen $190 .....e.g. 100 day EMA cuts across at $241 on 4 h time frame. So if we break past this tight 50,30 - 100 day EMA squeeze, move to 4hour chart for potential targets Watching targets on EMAs might help. 4 h, 2h time frames for now.Looking to see mixture of sideways and test of $240.

A crazy macro event could potentially lead to an influx of cash. Part of me would rather the world muddles along though! (I don't think it will) Everything thing i come across seems to point to a MACRO event (even from Gold perspectives). This makes sense for me. Like what Jim Rickards was talking about on the video i linked to earlier. All that coupled with the fact that Bitcoin itself is a tail event/black swan/anti-fragile and it makes for a delectable moon landingLook at EMAs on 6h charts - 200, 100, 50, 30.

(the rest who you follow)?The only thing that did well was the dollar. That tells me that the dollar is going to be king this time around. At least for a while. If the dollars and US stocks soar against everything again like they did in the late 1990s and emerging markets crash because they can't pay or collect on their dollar denominated debt, that's when sub-$100 bitcoin becomes possible. Because when rich Chinese whales and miners find that their apartments in Shanghai have crashed 65% in value, they aren't going to be playing (gambling) with bitcoin anymore. They're going to get serious about trying to survive the economic shitstorm. Bitcoin will bottom with everything else as capital races to quality (USA).So this is kind of a back-to-the-drawing-board time in bitcoin's life. Bitcoin is software and we can change it, but first we have to admit that we're in trouble. We don't have a million users. I don't care how many accounts Coinbase says they have. (Let's check http://www.bitcoinpulse.com , oh wait...) We have a few hundred thousand users at the most and most of us are primarily speculating. If more actual use doesn't emerge soon and the world's economy slows down more, then the speculators will sell this thing into the ground. Gold, oil, iron ore, and every other ""hard asset"" took beatings when China's market was crashing a week or two ago. What does that tell you? It tells me that hard-assets are not seen as safe havens this time around. (Let's be generous and assume bitcoin is a safe hard-asset.)So here we are here four years after 2011 when we envisioned how bitcoin would start rapidly expanding to take over black markets, international trade, remittances, e-commerce, etc. and it's just not happening and it's not scaling the way we thought it would scale. Companies like Bitpay are realizing that very few people are using bitcoin for e-commerce. They can't hire and expand like they thought they could.Interesting comment from /u/slowmoon from /r/BitcoinMarketsHope you find some of that interesting I'll admit to enjoying listening to Michael Norman too, for something a little more mainstream. I've been meaning to learn more about Mike Stathis too.HitTheBid (youtube channel) is also interesting and entertaining from a market perspective- he's a bit in your face and intense though.Related to Don is a stock picker sorry more like a commentator, known as Panama Orange, who always has interesting views (he's on twitter and stocktwits). I follow some blogs as well but none as intently as Don. I follow a few guys who all are part of the 'alt' media circles that also have been interviewed by Don over the years too. A guy who I have deep respect for (and is an online acquaintance) is someone called Don Harrold. He does a terrible job of promoting himself (also self admitted), especially since he stopped uploading youtube videos. I will ask him for a link to his paid service/s and post it here for anyone interested (which amount to market picks and also some tutorials for relative newbs like myself) which is a video service. Honestly, some of his number work and data analysis is incredibly concise. He doesn't boast, but he has a knack for timing market turning points.IvanLabrie ""Channels or trendlines aren't the be all end all of technical analysis, so this 'breakout' isn't guaranteed to drive BTC to 1000+, that's a lofty target.

Be safe out there traders.Everybody seems to be picking on the $25-75 range. The conditions for this would have to be just right, and lays on the extreme end of panic whereas $50-100 seems much more reasonable. The right set of circumstances have to be in place for this to materialize. We have to see how the next few weeks go with US / world economic conditions, money velocity of USD and also the world or market events that may unfold. Bitcoin price is highly uncertain at the moment. It's entirely possible BTC could be ramping up for the several thousand dollar run, seeing that order books on the sell (supply) side are so thin. Any significant buy orders can push the price up quickly currently.; ; Bullish after halving obviously; ; Bearish after 4-7 weeks, uncertain after; ; Bullish for the next 2-3 weeksIf you take a look at the order books, it seems likely whales have set us up for this drop to absorb cheap coins and panic sellers. The next run is going to induce some panic, as we may easily reach $240, $250 and maybe $260 if enough buyers jump in. The order books are thin on the sell side, so when price moves up it will be dramatic. But again, I have no idea. It does seem that when price falls, coins sell into stronger hands over time.By daretobear on /r/BitcoinMarketsI'm dubious of obvious chart patterns. like the cup and handle that the whole market was waiting for a month and a half ago.[img]http://i.imgur.com/Mj3u1qO.png?1Technicals and fundamentals are important, but a lot of traders forget that (at the end of the day) the market is ultimately made up of PEOPLE who get scared and dump or FOMO and buy at irrational price points.It's easy to step back and say, ""Why are you idiots selling at $227? There's a good chance that Bitcoin will be back to $1,000+ levels within two years."" But when you look at the here and now and the price drops from $240 to $227 and you've got the drop from $260 to $200 from a few weeks ago in the back of your mind, it's pretty easy to see why folks might not be too keen on holding.I agree with you on a lot of those points, but the truth is that the market is not at all serious and reasonable and is ABSOLUTELY FUD driven on short time frames.chewtoy on /r/BitcoinMArketsBitcoin will be mainstream the day this form of referencing changesI guess in a decade, IoT will be here.Did they mention an time frame in the article ?Support at 205$ ?Bullish support 204-208$:Look at the red rectangles.

I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Do not start trading in bitcoins until you have figured out on how to install the bitcoin wallet on your desktop and the way in which you can transfer you bitcoins from the exchange back to your wallet..The trading volumes around bitcoins continue to be strong and price volatility is likely to come down once more market makers enter the picture. Take small incremental positions in this truly geeky asset class at every dip. For minimized risks consider day trading in bitcoins, strategies could be exchange/currency arbitrage or pure market making.RecommendationGo long: Some of the smartest investors are long bitcoins; build your portfolio by taking long positions whenever the market tanks.OTC options contracts - do you fancy exotic options? Post your bids and offers at this site.Market making - the LOB (Limit Order Book) is just like that for any stock book with decent spreads. Just providing liquidity to the market will allow traders to earn a reasonable income. One can build additional complex order types such as stops, pegs and tick sensitive orders with any traditional quoting and market making applicationCurrency Arbitrage: Since bitcoin is traded in almost all major currencies, the cross currency arbitrage can also be played. Custom development would be required to develop links to a currency trading platform from your bitcoin trading excel sheet for executions without slippageThe trading fee schedule lies about .6% which is far lower than any other asset class through any broker. Money transfer between all these exchanges is a 10 minute affair as all you have to do is to transfer your bitcoins. You will never need to open separate bank accounts for any of these online exchangesPlease note that that there are exchanges which do offer full electronic trading. For example, Bitfloor offers full FIX gateways for market data and order management.Between these exchanges there is always an arbitrage available which can be played (see the screenshot below), for example at the time of writing this article, one could have bought bitcoins at USD 79 from bitstamp and sold it at USD 82.5 on mtGox, an instant return of 4.4%!. Of course there are execution slippages, particularly as both the sites still offer only screen based trading. However, they do publish the full order book online; with a little investment in script programming one can develop an application for auto punching of orders on the screen too.Bitcoin-CentralBitfloorBitstampBTC-EExchange arbitrage - Bitcoins are traded today in almost all important currencies on at least a dozen exchanges. The largest exchange with close to 75% market cap is MT. Gox. The other notable exchanges are:So what are the ways in which bitcoin can be traded to generate alpha?Anonymity - Until the government outright bans trading in bitcoin, the market is likely to find inflows from investors who seek complete anonymity while trading. Most exchanges will allow you to trade in bitcoin vs. USD (or any other currency) with a simple email based registration. (With no KYC norms, this is likely to also attract inflows from illegal areas such as drug trafficking, racketeering, and terrorist financing)New better trading platforms will emerge which will allow even more flexibility, such as shorting bitcoin to the tradersI have been tracking bitcoin since its inception, earlier it was just like a select club to which you wanted to be a member in order to satisfy your intellectual ego. However, now it seems that the interest has tipped over to other side into the mainstream attention. It has become a very large virtual online casino where everyone is trying to outsmart and out-speculate others. When select clubs become mainstream, billions usually follow, think Apple, think FacebookAs trading volumes increase and more market makers come into market, liquidity is bound to increase and volatility will fall. With a thriving exchange, bitcoins are as good as any other currency as long as they can be converted at current exchange rates. Think of them as IOUs or traveler chequesTax avoidance (for now) while the governments struggle to makes sense of all this. This would attract some investorsIn case valuation models for bitcoins fail, the resulting realization that they have no inherent value and not backed by a government would still turn out to be not so bad, because then true traders can focus only on the LOB (Limit Order Book) characteristics rather than worrying about fundamentalsBitcoin price modelling will be one of the most exciting fields which will come up. This would require quants to dabble in cryptography, hash rates, ASICs, and perhaps quantum computing too. Many exotic hedge funds and even large investment banks are likely to use their proprietary models for creating OTC markets around bitcoin. Bitcoin funds are already in offering. It is heartening to note that the fund manager is a systems developer and a mathematician, more power to the IT folksTraditional financial investors in gold (at least in Cyprus) will divest some of their assets into bitcoin. It gives them all the benefits of gold (except physically touching it) and amazing portability (carry it in your thumb drive, or just email it to your relatives in India)The underlying digital economy and the user base which is comfortable using bitcoin as money is only going to increaseIt's a very addictive nerdy concoction of computing, cryptography and dogma-free-economics which is hard to let go once tasted. Investors and traders will keep returning to this market despite all market inefficiencies (if any)Here are the top 10 reasons to support my hypothesis:In my humble opinion, bitcoin is no bubble but a novel and a genuine asset class, the valuation of which is not yet clear. Ignoring this asset class will be very expensive as bitcoin and other peer-to-peer-ledger-accounting currencies backed by maths and computing are here to stay.Even after the recent price crash, the volumes for bitcoin trading are strong. In fact, the volume at MtGox now is even higher than it was at the 9th of April when the prices peaked at above 240USD.After all, nobody ever paid a fortune for a tulip bulb after May 1637 when the bubble finally did burst.Lots of comments have been made on the bitcoin bubble; comparisons have been made with the 17th century Dutch tulip bubble. In bitcoin's brief life of 2 years, the market has already witnessed at least 2 bitcoin 'bubbles.' The first was in June 2011, when the price rocketed from less than 2 USD to 31 USD within a couple of months before settling back to around 2USD five months later. See the chart below. Rationally, nobody should have bothered about bitcoin after the first 'bubble'.In this article, we will not go into the pros and cons of using bitcoin as a currency, you can find tons of articles on that at Google. We would rather focus on what are the investment and trading opportunities available to investors in bitcoin.Evidently 2 events triggered the renewed interest in bitcoin.

When the next financial crisis hits, people will be confronted with a critical need to sort out what wealth is an illusion and what wealth is real. I expect Bitcoin to come out of this chaos as a huge winner.I was at one of the early talks for Andreas A. He said that Bitcoin will either be worth nothing or worth a lot. I agree.To those who are skeptical about Bitcoin I simply show them the charts and say, ""Why has Bitcoin not died?""Of these I see the home equity as by far the most risky.Bitcoin is 2.6% of my net worth. Home equity is 70% Gold bullion 16% Silver bullion 7%I've been accumulating, mostly in the 220 - 280 range during this extended correction.Several years ago I watched Bitcoin climb from $20 to $256 and then crash. I wanted to buy during the run up but could not pull the trigger. After the crash I waited to see if Bitcoin would die, but it did not, so I read the whitepaper and was immediately hooked. I started accumulating when Bitcoin was around $95, stopped accumulating when it crossed above $330, sold about 1/4 of my position on the rebound at about $1020 after the $1200 spike.

All we are dealing with is a correction upon a correction, all of which belongs to larger bearish impulse. So, what exactly follows a rallying correction in the midst of a large impulse move? ... You got it ... A completion of the bearish impulse ... It is this 5th wave which I would be waiting for.Yes, bulls can still stab their way to incremental heights, but at this point, we are talking about shedding more blood for less inch of terrain gained, whereby the risks are starting to outweigh the benefits, in terms of probability.Just some thoughts hereThe current 50% circled on the right shouldn't be taken seriously because I still do not know where price will ultimately retrace but I'm assuming it could reach a similar level as we saw at number 4 on the left of the chart close to 248/249.The striking similarity in price action is that all the key levels marked 1-4 have basically been respected. Essentially what I'm looking for now is where price stalls number 4 far right and begins to retrace so I can plot the fib tool looking for that 50% to see if it will indeed respect that level for a potential move higher.There's quite a bit going on in this chart but essentially what I'm looking at is similar price behaviour as we've seen before. On March 3rd we peaked out at 297.95 came down to 210 then we moved up to 246.57 then down to the low 220's before heading higher and pulling back to the 50% retracement level and making a move towards 300+.Global LBC chart bro ?BTC growing pole pole. good to see bottom up growthKabisa!"

Again, I can only say this because there is a level that the Predictive/Forecasting Model defines for itself as a ""Watch Line"", or defined as ""WL"" in all of the analyses I do. And once this line is broken, it demands that the analysis be pushed and stayed at the next level up times 4. I really love following this particular currency, as it offers a challenge like no other asset. However, the more I study and analyze it, the more it seems to fall in the category of institutionally-controlled asset. I say only because all other retail-level timeframes are not able to provide any reliable or consistent result relative to the analysis, as it proves me wrong every step of the way within the M5, M15 and H1 timeframes - Yet, these are retail-level frames, where the Predictive/Forecasting Model can usually decipher between the twoI'm signing up for this thread, if you don't mind.Karibu!a- b- cDoes this look familiar?EDIT: This count (truncated 5th where David has labelled 2) has almost been invalidated on the chinese exchanges, where we have a close to 100% retracement already (invalidation at 1845 CNY on OKC, 1850 on Huobi), but there may be an alt count there.BTW what is that chart for, and what happened next ?? Just read the title !! Great thread by the way Afrikoin Does seem a little out of proprtion time-wise though (EDIT: maybe not). Interested to hear any pro EWers chime in on this.However, in other charts (I think by Ryan on Masterluc's thread) it has been suggested that in the case of BTC, what is labelled as 2 is actually a truncated 5th of the previous C. In which case, drop from 300-200 is wave 1, and this is an a-b-c wave 2 retracement. Which would put as at a .75 retracement - perfectly reasonable for a wave 2 and could even go higher (invalidation at 300)Same with David's chart above, post #225Only valid if it is an expanding diagonal, as 4 overlaps with 1"

I think eboard10 is looking for this - a minor 4th wave retracement here (which may be complete), then a final 5th up. Would be cool to see an update from him. I'm also not sure this impulse is complete either and would not be surprised to see this, though given the number of extensions in the minor 3rd of the [y] on this chart, it may very well truncate anyway (especially in China), meaning the top is already in. Either way, I think we will struggle to push much higher here - just putting it out there more as a something to watch out for over the next couple of days - we will know soon enough ;Not sure why he considers it a w-x-y as opposed to an A-B-C, but the difference here, if any, is beyond my understanding of EWNice chart! Has same effect as the 'truncated 5th' option, $200 was bottom of a wave 1, this is the top of 2 and we are now entering a 3 that should be pretty deep and dramatic. I prefer Matthew's count TBH - the; w-x-y correction looks more in proportion to the wave 1 drop time-wise. Everything he says in this block of text is fact.

Failed 5th - double top at 5.On the chart below, 1 and 2 was a run up driven by Greece speculation on EU financial economic stuff. Do we have more fueled speculation now vs then? DOubt it.

Walmart is in deep trouble, they have had to give pay rises to their minimum wage employees at the same time as their revenue dropped. and this at a time when the dollar is strong and they are large importers.Yellen is probably the most powerful woman on earth currently, if the democrats lose the next election (and they will if there is a huge recession right before it) Yellen will be out so she will try every trick in the book to prevent it.when you accept the fact that almost every politician is a sociapath their actions make alot more sense.also central banks keep the money printers on to devalue their local curreny to boost exports, there is a race to the bottom and everybody loses.the whole system relies on the belief that everything will be ok in the end, aslong as everyone keeps spending. when people stop spending they need to incentivise it more, how do they do this? lower interest rates more and more to increase peoples spending power. how many $50,000 cars would be sold today if people couldnt get them on 0% finance? how many $500,000 houses.to be honest im not in the US so your local politics is not my strong point. monetary policy is the same as most so called democracies. offer tax breaks or spending promises to wealthy entities to buy votes and get elected. then borrow the money from the future to pay for today.The fact that the US can't raise rates points to exactly what you say - extreme weakness in the economy, where a large part of economic activity is only happening because of free liquidity. And this activity-through-liquidity is not the kind of activity that generates increases in wealth or standard of living, it is merely profit games without meaningful production.You think there's a difference between Republicans and Democrats in monetary policy? Lol. They're all keynesian, they're all neoclassicalist.The longer central banks have lower interest rates the harder it becomes to ever raise them again, personally I don't think they ever will by any meaningful amount unless they want to burst all the various credit bubbles to get it over and done with. If the most prosperous country on earth cant afford 0.25% interest rates you know everything is screwed. its being blamed on China but they are a production based economy. There is no western demand for Chinese goods so they cant sell their stuff, inventory levels are through the roof and commodities (oil, copper, lumber) have crashed because of this.The question is really is bitcoin considered a safe haven asset and hedge against inflation like gold or a speculative investment that people cant afford to bet on during times of crisis.so all the stops beings QE4 and possible negative interest rates to force banks to provide even more risky loans.I think Yellen will pull out all the stops to stop it happening before the US election cycle next year, no way a republican would re-nominate her.

The prior few times we've been pushing these levels (March & July 2015), we had initial spikes to over $300, and then a pullback that occurred over the course of a few days which setup a second push towards the highs reached in the prior days. However, those second pushes have ultimately failed and signaled a turning point in the market both times.

4327,1161207analyzed.txt,2015/10/30,"TL;DR: bitcoin had 2 bubbles: 2011 and 2013.""""So i don't think the exact motions will be comparable - you'd need to look at the 2011 daily to compare it to the current weekly to take into account differences in liquidity and time that i mentioned - and i think that's a fool's errand anyway. Nothing is ever going to be exactly the same. But i think the similarities are striking.;; 3 I'd expect that this is following that first bottoming out period - price may jump up to $500 and then hover around $300 for a while. Repeat jump to $900 and then hover around $700 for a while. Bubble still far away.;These were catalysts to restore some equilibrium in the market. Ironically, I think that these bubbles were necessary for price discovery. Normally, bubbles damage price discovery because there are yawning chasms of uncertainty where price hasn't bounced around. However, back then (and i think now), BTC corrected hard and floated too low for too long - eventually the market agreed that price should be substantially higher. This happened once, led to another softer bubble and stability.;; 2 There were 2 run-ups with bubble-like behavior following the 2011 peak.;;1 ;It took almost 2 years to reach previous highs ($32). That was at a time when there was no liquidity in the market at all. Bitcoin was like $5. It's been about 2 years since the $1200 day, and I'd expect another couple of years. I'm not wed to this idea and it's not my strongest conviction, but it's my best guess. My counter argument here would be that BTC will move less from trading / store of value and more to rails use-cases, exploding usership and demand, which would make the previous comparison irrelevant anyway. But all things equal and adoption occurring marginally, I don't expect $1,000 bitcoins again for a few years.As a result, I've always looked back to the 2011 aftermath for guidance - that's why i never liked to look at the ""bubblewatch"" etc. because they were looking at tiny microcosms and defining a single period as separate discrete events. My thought process about that:I have always thought that this market and the last bubble was much like the massive 2011 bubble up to $32. I don't view the April 2013 or Nov. 2013 bubbles as separate events - just one giant bubble. If you think about that year as a giant bubble, and and 2011 as a giant bubble, I think it provides a clearer picture. Liquidity is always increasing with price, so it takes more and more time and effort to move the price. That is a major factor as to why there was a pause in the summer of 2013. Think of liquidity / market cap as ""stretching out"" or ""zooming in"" or ""magnifying"" everything in the market. Movement takes more money, more time, and more movement (think fractals) to occur.""""Holy shit - if this keeps on, price will hit RSI resistance on the WEEKLY. That hasn't happened since the last bubble. That that will be some serious ass resistance.I could be wrong, but it helps for perspective. I'm in the camp that thinks we're still in a larger correction - similar to October2014, and June 2014.Everything else speaks for further correction (I think this means stability) after reaching a new plateau at ~$300What makes me skeptical is the huge volume of the last move.It is never wrong to be open in different perspectives. I, too, am waiting for a price correction to at least test if whether we are ready for a bigger push or not. For now, it seems like this train doesn't want to be stopped at the moment. Also I noticed that during nighttime in China, the price rise seem to halt or slow. China has the big hand and players in here even though the volumes aren't real.;Wyckoff TheoryThat being said, I am watching closely for a potential shooting star pattern to develop here.likely did just get smashed.I am also loooking out for something similar forming for a top of this 'correction'""Weekly RSI about to be overbought for the first time since the bubble.""Need more to say more. trading is going to be great with the coming volatility. currently the smaller time frames suggest sideways consolidation with a risk of entering fourth wave territory but ultimately contain the evidence for continuation.We are probably at the later stage of a third wave finishing with a fifth blowout. I think we can safely say that we are at a stage in an impulse that will form a primary wave followed by a wave 2 correction.

As shown in this chart it was a (B) wave. Elliott Wave Principle describes B waves as phonies. Text: ""B waves are phonies. They are sucker plays, bull traps, speculators' paradise, orgies of odd-lotter mentality or expressions of dumb institutional complacency (or both).....If the analyst can easily say to himself, ""There is something wrong with this market"", chances are it's a B wave. "" . This is precisely what happened. People got trapped into thinking we have a new bull market in bitcoin, price rose to above $500 only to fall back below $400 in a matter of hours.; This is a perfect lession in Elliott waves. We know that 5-wave moves determine the direction of the market. Therefore for us to proclaim that the bull market in bitcoin has resumed, we MUST get a five wave move upwards since a low.

One of the big challenges that leading companies in the industry face is scaling data centers. It normally takes tremendously wealthy companies such as Google and Facebook spending hundreds of millions of dollars on sophisticated ways to scale. They have had so much trouble they started the open compute project to help eachother with this problem of scaling. This relates to my point of private blockchains later on. What is crazy about Bitcoin is the currency which creates the economic incentive for someone to participate in mining. The rate at which these compute resources get distributed, scale and evolve is simply phenomenal. Whereas traditionally it took executive management planning and overseeing large custom projects to construct their data centers. Even then it is still proprietary to that company and depends on the business model of the company. (Facebook can spend 100 million on a data center in Colorado because they count on growing by billions of users, etc.) The point I am getting at is in order for a private blockchain to scale and provide the security, it takes internal resources from X company which will dramatically increase the cost of managing these compute resources. Whereas Bitcoin the currency provides a cheaper and more secure entry onto the blockchain. It is essentially outsourcing these entries more competitively when you take blockchain vs blockchain. Unless the token has value some other entity has to provide the backing of the physical infrastructure which again adds cost, is not decentralized and is less secure. Eventually these private blockchains will collapse.""Bit of a ramble on why I feel Bitcoin the currency is the real breakthrough, not the blockchain.https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3trnlb/bitcoin_the_currency_is_the_real_breakthrough_not/cx8pxtx"""" I remember an eye-opening comment on the Bitcoin dev mailing list perhaps several months ago. Someone said something like, ""It's refreshing to see the BTC price mentioned in a discussion about incentive design in the software."" That points to a pervasive extremely narrow view in Core dev that tends to see code in isolation, and perhaps that extends to explaining why blockchain without Bitcoin has so much superficial appeal to the uninitiated. Ignoring the economics leads to a lot of nonsense ideas.

Cant be botheredWhich is why, i agree with RyNinDaCleM here when he redraws the labels to show the cycles are taking longer - similar, but longer days.In the case of bitcoin, bitcoin today is not bitcoin of yester years - so, while growth might occur in a similar fashion, I would expect number of days to vary eg X4 or xY.For example, think about children growing up, they grow at different paces at each stage of their life. Not that any growth is superior to another, but it does not take the same amount of time because at each growth level, complexity varies.When i was reading OPs idea, the first thing i thought was he was right about human behaviour in herds as predictable, but also thought he was wrong in assuming it would repeat itself in the same number of days cycles. That i find, cannot happen in a case where there is growth. Growth in nature is not linear or proportional.I agree with you, regarding the length of time taking longer or in other words, a larger cycle.RyNinDaCleM, you are trully smart! respect.Where F and G were all of 2014 and we are still somewhere in the H. Or at best, in the I. There is also the possibility that F was the entirety of 2014 and we are in G since January this year. I don't really have an opinion on which is more likely.Next, compare price of everything after the $1200 peak with the 2011/12 data you have there. Your corresponding points hit the bottom and began rising in the latter. In 2014, it continued down. This tells me that we are in a much larger cycle here that isn't really comparable to the 2010-2012 data you have without first stretching that data about 4x. I would argue that your F, G and H are more appropriately set up like this (D) In 2011, D was already making higher highs (HH's) above the B. In Elliott wave, that was a subwave of the whole rise to $31.9099. In this case, it was a 3. In 2013, it was still part of the correction, or in the best supporting argument, a subwave of a subwave, 1 of 5. Visually, it makes no HH, so it really doesn't look similar at all.Yes!

This scenario is also possible but in my view maybe a bit less likely.""Safest bet is to hodl if you are already in. Otherwise maybe consider selling (or shorting) if it appears to bounce down from that horizontal line. Word of caution when bitcoin is in full on bull mode sometimes the corrections are flat but I\x92m not sure we are there yet.Volume seems lower at the moment maybe signifying a bit of wariness. If this does correct down to the bottom of the bull channel that will be quite a large drop somewhere near $350 I\x92d estimate.""Bitcoin is nearing a level of potential horizontal resistance. Looking at the rhythm of other peaks and dips I can imagine its time for a bit of a dip. This is just my suspicions not really \x91analysis\x92.

4365,1161207analyzed.txt,2015/12/15,"No ""corrlilation"" between stocks and bitcoins. Only inside your fertile imagination.whats your view on gold, it will go up right?My final thought on this, and not working on theories of Elliott waves or TA in general, is that if there is a fractal pattern becoming evident, it would present itself such that you could view similar trends on various time scales, as I have done above.; That would mean the original theory is not invalidated, but rather additional trends become evident by changing the scale of the X-axis.; Again, we will see.which again puts us close to back to the beginning of a new cycle.; Again, time will tell.The other possibility is a period of compressed time as shown above, followed by an expansion in X bringing our timeline back to the original; something like this:OTOH, if we do see a significant growth over the next month or 2, I would say the time frame has not compressed, and the original cycle periods hold.; In the above plot we are starting to generate some disparity with the previous cycle at this point using this idea, so I think we will get an idea over the next couple of months which trend fits better.As I stated before though, this would mean that there is no discernible cycle to be found, and while I will continue to track it, the time frame of any future peaks becomes much hard to guess at.No questioin that doing this results in a very interesting graph that parallels the previous cycle much closer.; This would put us in a situation where we are on the tail end of a phase 2, however, it could mean a phase 3 that more closely follows that of cycle 1.; The net result is a possible short term period of uptrend in price, followed by a period of slow growth.; Not a bad thing.; However, in cycle 1 this phase (3) did not overtake the ATH we reached in phase 2, so if that holds again it would mean we won't get over ~US$1200 for the forseeable future.OK, so I replotted the data overlaying everything basically since the November 2013 runup to ATH with about a 3x compression. Keep watchinglots of lurkers here ey?Outlook bullishHeres zoomed out view of same chart for perspective.Bitcoin finding resistance on one of the trendlines, looks like it wants to break up and test the middle line of the fork again which was where it reached on the last spike the other day.

Bitstamp and Bitfinex have trouble following, their bid / ask ratios are below those of the 12th December, so they would crash if not following Huobi.But it is possible that the expected support test to have been truncated, due to greatly increased bids on Huobi, over 40% over the Dec 12 pre-crash levels.

Yup. This is spot on. I am all for drawing lines, but in the end this is what is going to make the price go up or down in the coming months.

I think there is a chance there could develop a bear trap that starts off looking that way though..on that note, the time I have drawn in for the C is not a requirement, nor is the depth. It could be something that plays out in just a few months. and even makes a higher low as a failed C. The chart depicts a textbook structure... The same way I always draw it out initially.

In deed there may be some other permutation or combination of them, I cannot reasonably envisage nor be able to show as the chart will become just jungle of lines. But hope it will illustrate both the likely complexity and the possibilities that the final low is yet in the future. This might not be the answer you are looking for nor will it assist you or anyone who might feel that they wish to know where is the absolute low. However, no matter how may times I am asked, I cannot add any more than above and which in various forms, I have already expressed before.So in that context, I am open to both possibilities that final low is in place or that we are retracing the decline from Nov 2013 high to Jan 2015 with final low is yet to form.Now if you are realistic, I don't think anyone in their right minds could say with 100% certainty which of the eventualities will be true. I am not aware of any method which can say that the final low is in. Only time will tell.Alternatively, and it is very speculative view, that we might see a massive contracting triangle which includes the price decline from Nov 2013 high in the form of 3-3-3-3-3 configuration. In this event whilst we will continue to move in up & down cycle with each contracting but consisting of 3 swings. In this event it has a long way to go before it is completed but at least the lowest swing of pattern formed in Jan 2015 will be the lasting low.However I cannot see that being the case, nor has anyone yet satisfactorily shown me the valid wave counts. So if we do not have the 5 wave impulsive move of the Jan 2015 low, then in my view it seems that whatever it is, it's a part of corrective move of the decline from Nov 2013 - Jan 2015. Now this could either be a zigzag or some sort of triangle or other combination of moves to the upside, even if this results in a price moving much higher ie, 700+ but on completion would likely result in eventually dropping back towards Jan 2015 low.So in my answer to the above, forgetting that this is a Bitcoin (and all the competing sentiments I observe amongst the Bitcoin community) and taking this as purely a financial instrument (which in the minds of many clearly it is not and I have no issue with that), and looking at the price action since Nov 2013 high, it seems that we have a zigzag decline resulting in Jan 2015 low. Ordinarily by this corection, I could conclude that overall correction is complete. If this was the case however, you would at least look for 5 wave impulsive move of the Jan 2015 low based on EW principle. Many analysts and traders feel that the strong rally we have experienced is the evident 5 wave move I should be looking for.First of all let be absolutely clear. I have not inherent to agenda nor wish necessarily wish to see the price of Bitcoin's decline or will it just because I might say so. Since I get the feeling from several questions and my interaction with others that leaqds me to suspect that many feel that no matter what, I will always suggest that the price will decline.Thank you for your question. Not entirely sure what you are seeking from me nor if you are simply wishing to see if I will ever change my view.Hello DanV, has continuous uptrent in the recent days and overshoot fo your targets changed everything in your opinion in the main chart?

While I often have an issue having the same outlook as Dan since in his shorter term charts, he is often not just wrong, but very wrong, I do share his longer term outlook here. That was a thoughtful post and echos my thoughts. It is true that there is no clear impulsive move from the January low without coming up with the most rare and ridiculous counts offered in EW -The expanding diagonal.

Although litecoin normally has its own all time highs roughly in sync with bitcoins movements, this halving occuring at a time when litecoin was already at a very depressed price and bitcoin is still well below its own all time high.
