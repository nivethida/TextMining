Essentially a million dollars worth of bitcoins is being sold every day. This is not miners mining and being Bitcoin supporters so they are more likely to hold than sell, but certain selling. At the moment $1 million would send the price down $30. It may not go down that far completely due to other adoption but it is a constant drain.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}We always fought for the chicken vs egg thing of people not having something to spend bitcoins on so they didn't buy them (which discouraged people from offering things for sale for bitcoins) but now that we have someone big offering people the opportunity to spend them on everyday items, it may be draining the price.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It is good in the long run because it encourages adoption (and they said they would start holding some bitcoins soon) but in the short term is it pushing the price down?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}And will this happen every time a huge retailer starts accepting bitcoin?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Edit: Article I took the $1 million per day from was 100% typo by the writer of article.
chessnut	924	March 23, 2014, 10:28:21 AM	the forces that shape the bitcoins charts are not at all commercial, they are speculative. 1000 bitcoins a day is no big deal, especially in little chunks. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}remember that those who spend with bitcoin are likely to buy those coins back if they are holders, and if they are not holders, chances are that they had to buy those coins before they spent them. the demand and supply re nullified.

So every single Bitcoin they add to supply is a Bitcoin added to demand.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}There might be a tiny bit of short-term downward pressure as people who hold Bitcoins but don't really want to hold them take advantage of an opportunity to easily monetize them. But this is more than made up for by the increased value Bitcoins will have because they can be more easily spent.
Tzupy	1456	March 23, 2014, 10:38:12 AM	Those spending bitcoins (large sums) are mostly long-term holders. They will not buy back bitcoins now, but will wait for the real bottom.{ChangeLine}This is bearish, as I already said in January. But once the price will drop further, overstock sales paid with bitcoins will slow down.
AJMiles	56	March 23, 2014, 10:38:42 AM	The way I see it, the ecosystem cycles through buying Bitcoin to be spent at Overstock, and Overstock selling it back to someone else, and then someone buying or using Bitcoin to spend it back on the site again. Overstock's circulation is very good for Bitcoin, and I highly doubt its hurting it. Its causing more buys than hurtful sell pressure. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Like others said, it is certainly speculative by the looks of what is currently draining the price.

LOADING.READY.RUN	133	March 23, 2014, 02:21:47 PM	I'm not sure whether or not overstock.com sales might drain the price on the short term (although I'm inclined to believe they're just too small for this), but the important thing is: Overstock.com makes Bitcoin more useful, and therefore more attractive for people to possess. The more companies follow overstock to accept BTC, the better for Bitcoin on the mid- to long term.
Wilhelm	826	March 23, 2014, 02:42:22 PM	I'd assume a good flow of money gives stability in price. We are seeing a stable price so maybe it's a good thing. Hope we go to da moon again 
kodiak1120	213	April 10, 2014, 12:29:40 PM	I think they are causing the price to go down...; think about it.; Nobody is buying bitcoin (which would cause the price to; go up) just to buy something on Overstock or Tiger Direct.; {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}People who already have bitcoins are using them to buy stuff.; Overstock and Tiger Direct then immediately sell those bitcons on the various exchanges.; Thus, the more popular it becomes to spend bitcons on Overstock and Tiger Direct, the more already-owned bitcons are going to be basically converted to fiat currency.; {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}When you buy something on Overstock or Tiger Direct, you are indirectly converting your bitcons into fiat currency.; That's not a problem when we're talking about smaller merchants, but when it's a larger online retailer like Overstock.com, it results basically in a huge increase in sell orders without a corresponding buy order (because these are already-owned coins).; More sell orders than buy orders = lower price. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I'm not suggesting we should stop buying things with bitcoins... I shop on overstock.com all the time and sometimes just to support their efforts in accepting bitcons.; Buying things with bitcoins will be beneficial for bitcoin in the longterm, but I think it does somewhat account for the recent price drop we've been seeing.; {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}; 
gentlemand	1596	April 10, 2014, 12:53:40 PM	If I remember rightly it was about $200K in the first week and the $1 million figure was in total after a few weeks. I assume that's slowed to a crawl now so the effect on the day to day price is a drop in the ocean.

That you can use Bitcoins to buy stuff on Overstock or Tiger Direct makes them more valuable than they would be otherwise. While people won't buy Bitcoins just to use on Overstock or Tiger Direct, people who buy Bitcoins for other reasons (such as speculation) will be more interested in holding them the easier they are to spend.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Consider someone who could accept a part of their salary in Bitcoins and who is marginally interested in holding them over the medium to long term as a possible investment. One barrier to holding them is the difficulty in selling them when they might wish to do so. Knowing they can use them to buy stuff increases their desire to have and hold Bitcoins. Otherwise, the demand they would create would not exist.
jamesc760	448	April 13, 2014, 02:24:13 AM	Because bitcoin is currently a medium of speculation, not a medium of exchange, the big retailers' participation in the whole bitcoin craze is not healthy at this point in time. Basically, bitcoin is NOT ready to be used in this manner. If and when major retailers like Amazon start taking bitcoins, it will crash the price. It's better that these retailers stay the f**k away from bitcoins, so it can go To Da Moon.

BTCtrader71	778	April 13, 2014, 03:34:02 AM	Quote from: GigaCoin on March 23, 2014, 02:45:30 PMNo one in their right mind will convert fiat to an exchange buy bitcoin then buy something off overstock after loosing all the fees and probably lost on the price fluctuation.{ChangeLine}Paying on Overstock with bitcoin means that you don't have to enter personal credit card information which can get stolen. That is not an insignificant thing, when you consider things like the recent theft of credit card data from Target, or the catastrophic Heartbleed bug.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}
TERA	574	April 13, 2014, 05:13:41 AM	Where do you get the figure $1 Million per day? I thought it was more like $1 million per month.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}You can't argue against adoption, at any point. Adoption is the only thing that is going to turn bitcoin from a speculation bubble into something that actually has a fundamental value. It's just a weird and unintuitive journey to get from one point to the other. Coins SHOULD be getting spent and not hoarded. Let the hodlers dump their coins into merchants - it's a healthy decline that has to reverse eventually as long as adoption continues, and then it will be much stronger.

Which is more valuable, a crypto-currency that you can spend on Amazon or an otherwise identical crypto-currency that you can't spend on Amazon? The only thing that will make Bitcoins valuable for something other than speculation is value as a means of exchange.
