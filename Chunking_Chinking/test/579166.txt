Recharge codes is just anonther escrowish way of injecting money into an exchange if you can't do a direct bank transfer.{ChangeLine}As what I can read they are revising some code/method to enhance stability. You can still withdraw so you should not get goxxed.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Stop the FUD!!

This is old news, posted 13 hours ago.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Effectively all the reason anybody even reports news at all.

Why do they call it "suspend all bank recharge functions" and not "bank deposits"?{ChangeLine}"bank recharge functions" and "recharge codes" seem very similar terms...{ChangeLine}

Seems like it from this quote: {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}"If you run into any issues while recharging your account.." I assume he is talking about users OKCoin account. 
jamesc760	448	April 21, 2014, 07:41:14 PM	So, which is it, suspension of ALL bank deposits or change in recharge method? OP's title is quite misleading. Stop the FUD. Nobody gives shite about China anymore.
