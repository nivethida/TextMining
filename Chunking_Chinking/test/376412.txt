I will not sell at $1200, bitcoins will be worth millions. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}New mentality: I have got to sell, the price is going down. Why would I hold, I might lose everything. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Old one: Look at these cheap coins ($550 vs $1200) BUY! {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}New one: Look at these expensive coins. Now they are $550, in 2010 they were only a few cents. SELL! {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Old one: I am investing in disruptive technology!{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}New one: I have been scammed!{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Lots of people have been burnt buying at 1200, and they want to get out. Many early adopters will try to cash in their fortunes.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Fear will replace greed. Reality will replace delusion. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Look out below. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Bitcoin below 10 dollars in 2014.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

mgio	546	December 18, 2013, 11:31:34 PM	Wasn't this kind of the case with everyone who bought at above $200 back in April?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Just hodl and wait for the next bubble when Bitcoin will go to $5,000 or more.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I agree that bitcoin probably will go down in the short term. But it will eventually go back up. Especially if the Winklevoss ETF gets approved.

We have already had enormous world wide media coverage. I dont see how you can reflate this bubble, thus I predict the crash to complete in 2014.

the_sunship	230	December 19, 2013, 12:25:40 AM	many are sitting on "free" coins since they have recouped their initial investment and then some on the way up. Doubtful they are going to get very fearful and sell all.

You do realise that Bitcoin is a technology, and not a financial market right? Bitcoin doesn't "crash". The exchange rate does and that's because it's a currency speculation market. Big whoop. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Ah but it could "crash". If there exists a bug in the block relay code that on processing a given block configuration somehow causes access to unallocated memory after relaying, the majority of the network would segfault. Not that this would ever happen, but it would be hilarious.

You just postulate that the technology is doomed because some people trading currencies lost a lot of money on BTC trades. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}If I go long AUD/USD and lose heaps of money should I just tell you that Australia is doomed?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I have explained it already (see my post history).

That is why I have the idiot on ignore.
intense	50	December 19, 2013, 05:01:30 AM	The volume of trade around the 1200 mark is low compared to the significant volume around the 450 - 900 mark.{ChangeLine}Some of the bag holders at 900 will dump and lose out but most will either hold, or buy more, which has been proven by the strong floor at 460, was tested on the way up and on the way down.
Ozymandias	434	December 19, 2013, 07:00:01 AM	The only people who were correct in claiming that we were going to $10 were those who claimed that before Oct 26, 2012. The ones who claimed that we were going to less than that were correct even less often.

Good luck finding one.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}True, the ONLY real cataclysmic events which could have the power to destroy BTC are either something regulation-related (ban) or failure of the BTC protocol. Don't have any idea how likely these are of course.

ironstove	111	December 19, 2013, 01:02:48 PM	Bitcoin won't fail, and it won't hit single digits... Doubt double is even possible. There is way too much support and adoption for the technology already and it's only scaling higher. Keep dreaming about your cheap coins which will never come.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I'm calling this bottom @ high to mid 300s. If it strikes that price within the next 2-3 weeks, that's the hot time to buy. Anything lower than 300 is just too much of a steal. I think that 420 might be the ATL that we see, which means most everyone missed their buying opportunity. I am still holding fiat as I am going to take the risk of finding a better opportunity elsewhere. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}In other news:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

Our government and regulators and innovators have given the "ok" to bitcoin.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Come to think about it, instead of meeting you, we will just wave to you above $2000 in 2014.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine};{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Lol. You are praising a falling star (crashing would be more accuarte).{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The US is the biggest debtor of them all. Huge liabilities, big government mentality, anti free market philosophy is on the rise and Obama is a socialist in office. The FED is printing like there is no tomorrow. Americans consume (debt financed) but save and produce nothing.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}China on the other hand is one of the largest creditors, is liberating its markets (as it has been burned by communism), and is actually moving away from the dollar (China has been propping up US consumption and living standards). Once the yuan is free floating (not pegged to the dollar) and once the dollar crashes, you will hopefully wake up! The Chinese save (one of the highest saving rates in the world) and produce!{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}China is the future.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Even bigger LOL at you thinking that the US government will be more friendly to bitcoin, if it feels threatened by it (dollar monopoly=power remember?).{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

Kaiji	140	December 21, 2013, 03:51:27 PM	{ChangeLine}Too many people with fiat waiting to scoop up cheap coins. Only way it will reach single digits is if there is a serious crackdown on btc. If it reaches single digits there is a good reason for it and it is unlikely to rise up again.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}People are playing the holding game now; though after the China got out of the game I have a hard time seeing how the price can go back to $1000.

If they realise this wont happen it will collapse in price. So lets look at these two aspects.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}1) Medium of exchange.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Bitcoin is only a medium of exchange when merchants accept it and hold onto it. Right now merchants are dumping bitcoin for dollars, so its not being used as a medium of exchange. This btw. also throws the transaction cost benefit argument right out of the window (spread).{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Are you a merchant accepting bitcoin?; If so, you can speak to your own experience, but you cannot assume that all merchants are instantly dumping bitcoin for fiat.; While I am not a merchant, I do use my bitcoin income to purchase items, rather than just exchanging them for fiat.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quote from: porc on December 07, 2013, 02:30:32 PMNow will merchants ever accept bitcoin and hold onto them?{ChangeLine}No.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Why?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}a) Governments have already effectively made it impossible for people to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange, as they expect taxes to be paid on bitcoin gains. Thus it cant function as a medium of exchange (same goes for gold btw.). Unless Government loses its control on its money monopoly this law wont be altered.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Governments expect taxes on all income.; Why would bitcoin be different?; Are you saying that USD can't function as a medium of exchange because governments expect taxes to be paid when you gain USD?{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quote from: porc on December 07, 2013, 02:30:32 PMb) Governments will prohibt merchants from accepting bitcoins.

Not likely.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Your earlier arguments already have flaws, so this conclusion is not valid.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Quote from: porc on December 07, 2013, 02:30:32 PMAlso Bitcoin is a technology, that can be outcompeted by other altcoins. Your wallet can be hacked. The average citizen cant judge if the code can or can not be hacked and thus more bitcoins created. If you want to store wealth over a long period of time investing in a technology is not the best and easiest option. Also Bitcoin is not useful or wanted. If you ask a Bitcoiner what can I do with it they will say: dump it on the next guy it will go up in price! Gold and Silver where always wanted (jewlery and nowadays industry) and thats why they became MONEY in the first place! They have unique properties and everybody love to hold them in their hand. This will always be the case ensuring significant value and acceptance. Nothing like this can be said for bitcoins. Thus I dont believe bitcoin will function as a store of value in any significant way.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}This paragraph reads like a combination of FUD combined with wild generalized assumptions.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I'm not saying you're wrong about the exchange rate of bitcoin dropping.; But your arguments are flawed.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I do wonder what your motivation is for these posts.; Why come to a Bitcoin forum and try to spread a message that we're all doomed?; Unless you're just trying to stir up an argument.; At that, my friend, is the definition of a troll.
