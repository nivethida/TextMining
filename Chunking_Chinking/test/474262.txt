michaelzhang	56	February 19, 2014, 07:53:53 AM	Hi, everyone{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I\x92m an ordinary Bitcoin player from China. About two weeks ago, I happened to find a website that publishes free daily trend analysis on various cryptocurrencies. As a rookie in this speculative market, I adopted a few suggestions from it and I made money! {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The latest successfully prediction from the website is the movement of the market maker of Doge. I(most of his readers, I think) successfully acted as a \x93free rider\x94 and enjoyed the rise. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The author originally started his analysis from tianya.cn, the most popular forum in China, and then started his own website www.bit-sky.com. His daily analysis covers Bitcoin, Litecoin, Doge, IFC, UNO, BTG, HBN, CGB, etc.. Because his suggestions always proved to be correct, lots of people with big money are operating just as he indicates.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Since Chinese players exert a big influence on the market, foreign friends may also find the analysis helpful. And good news! The website has begun to publish English version daily analysis.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The latest is here, fresh and hot, daily updated:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}http://www.bit-sky.com/index.php/english{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I'll update his latest analysis in this poster everyday.{ChangeLine}Wish you find them helpful!~{ChangeLine}Enjoy your play in cryptocurrency world! ^^{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}P.S. (February 21){ChangeLine}The author has emphasized for many times on the brief-time validity of his buying suggestions, so if foreign friends read the daily analysis late and find the coin recommended has risen sharply, it is strongly advised that you don\x92t buy high. Just wait for the next chance.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}P.P.S. (February 21){ChangeLine}As I mentioned above, the author originally started his analysis from tianya.cn, the most popular forum in China. His poster in the forum soon attracted massive attention and was clicked 572,910 times(by the time I wrote) within less than 4 months. This is the link:{ChangeLine}http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-develop-1450475-1.shtml{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Due to his accurate predictions, a lot of bitcoin players became his fans and readers (including some market makers, I guess). Since a large number of bitcoin players are involved in this poster, I think its content may serve as a useful reference for foreign friends to know about what Chinese bitcoin players are thinking and doing. So I intend to translate the highlights of the poster bit by bit in the following days and put them in this poster, trying to serve as a bridge between China and English speaking world.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I welcome all of your comments and suggestions.{ChangeLine}

michaelzhang	56	February 21, 2014, 04:51:44 AM	IFC rose immediately by 10% after the release of the author's analysis at 16:20 Beijing time on 20 Feb. 
seleme	1148	February 21, 2014, 04:57:47 AM	IFC will probably go down more. It's on the level where last pump started and those levels usually don't hold, specially with such low volume and support.

Bitcoin is governed by math, that is far from 'by people'. History was of bad records of authorities governing currnecy, and bitcoin removed the authority, but it did not give power back to the people - the true 'by the people' means you can issue I-O-U as much as you like, and the value of these I-O-U in compare to math-governed hard currency (bitcoin), is based on how much the community trusts you. e.g. MtGox's I-O-U is currenly valued 40% of real coins. A currency system that designed I-O-U into it is a currency can be called a currency 'by the people'. Bitcoin is a foundation for such a system, providing a digital rigid value to back against, but itself is not a currency 'by the people'.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}"Democratic currency" is a wrong name for bitcoin, even 'anti-authority currency' or "discipline currency" or "democratic currency's foundation" are better. There is quite a distance to cover from discipline to democracy. The author may think the alternative crypto-currencies floating around in China menas "you can issue your currency" - it does not, none of the alternative hot new brands in China allows you to issue I-O-U. Duplications of a system is not extending the system, and they are better called anarchy instead of democracy.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}It is commonly agreed among economists that a rigid discipline currency as the only currency is a bad idea - think about the 30s' recession - don't worry, this will never happen: bitcoin is either complementary to fiats (now), or fiats will be complementary to bitcoins, or a new crypto-currency representing I-O-U issued by the people will be complementary to bitcoin. A pure bitcoin-only world is disasterful, but it is so easy to correct that it is impossible to really happen - by issuing complementary currencies. We are closer to the ideal model but we are not there yet.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}I think the word "Democratic currency" revealed more about Chinese people (disclose: I am) than about the currency. Under a strong government we are so thirst of democracy that we hurry to label any anti-authority ideas with it. It is also dangerous, because we (Chinese people) long for something (democracy) that we don't have much experience and knowledge about - not knowing true water we risk drinking sea water to quench thirst - and this will be a major issue after the down-fall of the current China communist party.

I collected the author's statements in the poster and translated them into English, the full analysis on IFC is here:{ChangeLine}http://www.bit-sky.com/index.php/english/357-20140222-17-15-special-analysis-on-ifc{ChangeLine}IFC:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Max money supply: 90,600,000,000{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Price: 0.00048 RMB right now (www.bter.com){ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Block time: 30 seconds{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}As you can see, IFC has a gigantic issue size, an extremely low price and can be confirmed quickly.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}IFC enjoys good popularity in China. There are a lot of IFC websites, forums, and even TV advertisements.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Most important, its mining is coming to an end, only few coins are mined out everyday. This way, the price of IFC will not be pressed by the selling of newly-mined coins, it can rise with much more ease.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}For BTC, newly-mined coins everyday is about 1.6 million dollars, Litecoin 400,000 dollars, Doge 400,000 dollars. For a coin without the selling of newly-mined coins, the price is difficult to fall. On the flip side, even a small amount of buying can pull up the price. As a result, the market maker will be able to pull up the price easily and make much profit.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The author detected the existence of a market maker (on a big Chinese trading platform www.bter.com) in December last year, and successfully predicted his movement of pulling the price from 0.00051 to 0.0097 within 10 hours. Then the market maker somewhat stopped pulling (he is supposed to pull higher and attract new buyers), and began to act against the author, he turned around to lower the price in order to absorb more coins, I guess the reason is that the market maker suddenly saw the poster.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The author possesses 1.5 billon coins, together with his readers\x92 buying, there are about 10 billion coins. This is the main reason why the market maker acted against him, he wants to grab the coins out of his hands.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}From January 27 to today, the price of IFC has been going down continuously for 25 days. It doesn\\'t fall with BTC, neither does it rise with Doge, it behaved abnormally and began to dive recently(see the chart below)&#65292;now the price is lower than the market maker\x92s position-building cost. It is a golden opportunity to buy in!{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Despite the author\x92s favor on IFC, he now seems to be sick and tired of playing mind games with the market maker.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}IFC also has its drawbacks, worry about its hashing power, risk of 51% attack, etc.. The author suggested 10% allocation of your money on this coin. You may lose, of course. Anyway, what we are playing is probability.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine};

And how does it work? Well, let me explain in detail.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}A DCC should possess the following features:{ChangeLine}1.It adopts blockchain mechanism (This is the most important).{ChangeLine}2.The genesis block generates all coins all at once and the coins go to one account.{ChangeLine}3.There is a minimum trading fee required.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Genesis block holder is naturally the issuer. Due to the democratic feature of cryptocurrency, He is supposed to do the following things if he wants his coins to appreciate:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}First, he will give out his coins for free to make people know about it and persuade them to accept this currency.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Second, in order to guarantee the hashing power, he will trade with himself in order to provide high fees to miners.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Third, by using his other personal property (like BTC) as security, he offers an exchange rate of the currency and works as an exchange center for others.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Fourth, he will spare no efforts to develop applications of this currency in order to further promote usage of the coin.&#12288;&#12288;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Many people dislike the fact that too many \x93IPO coins\x94 are owned by the issuer. In fact, every coin, including Bitcoin, has the problem of \x93issuer hoarding\x94. They only differ in the proportion of hoarding. As long as the price reaches their expectation, they will sell, once sold, this problem is resolved.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}In addition, every coin has a market maker, even BTC is no exception. Market makers are just big holders, they don\x92t promote, neither do they develop applications; they just drink the blood of retail investors. They are absolutely more wicked than the original issuer.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Coming back to the point, we need to rely on the core of democurrency---blockchain mechanism---a superb decentralized, anti-cheating monetary and financial system. Once equipped with this system, together with powerful applications, this currency is bound to achieve huge success.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}You may argue: nobody in this world is able to promote such a coin, but imagine, just imagine, what if the issuer is a GOVERNMENT? ...This idea might blow your mind, but it may well come true sooner than you expect.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}All rights reserved, anyone who adopts this idea is required to donate 100BTC.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}My address&#65306;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}BTC: 19bbXVUgCP5EfAoGbrBKePMRf3TuxCZ2fs ;{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}For more useful discussions and analysis, click here:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}http://www.bit-sky.com/index.php/english{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}You'll find more than you expect!~{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}

More often than not, the issuer of a certian coin, if they have pre-mined the coins a lot, may want to do the job of a market maker, but it's very rare because they are not professional in this aspect.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}As for the author, he is a friend of mine who is proficent in cryptology, computer, speculation and finance. In democurrency world, ;he feels just like a fish in water.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}To trade USD for IFC, well, Cryptsy is dangerous, don't touch it. IFC often cannot be withdrawn from it. Most IFC are traded on a Chinese trading center, www.bter.com, you may consider buying IFC here with your LTC.

michaelzhang	56	March 04, 2014, 09:14:26 AM	Money contributes more to bad guys,so does Bitcoin{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Let\x92s imagine a world without money, and think how good guys and bad guys behave in this money-free world.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The good guys get their wanted commodity through barter. Although it\x92s not convenient and a bit troublesome, but everyone can eventually get what they want. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}As for the bad guys (thieves, for example), if they steal a lot of goods of low value, they would find it difficult to carry these stolen goods. If they steal goods of high value, when they exchange the goods for something like food, they\x92ll get a lot of goods of low value which can\x92t be easily transported either.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The point is, the bad guys need to carry all his property with him all time to make it easier to escape once found by the police. Therefore, the bad guys badly need something that is universally recognized, of high value, highly divisible, and can be easily stored and transported. What kind of goods measures up to these standards? that is money!{ChangeLine}So, money contributes more to the bad guys than to the good guys. It is safe to say that currency actually enhanced the ability of bad guys to encroach social wealth.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}From the discussion above, we can easily understand why bad guys are the first to use BTC. Consequently, we should not ban Bitcoin.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}As a matter of fact, all the latest technology: weapons, communications technology, transportation technology, camouflage and so on, contributes more to the bad guys than to the good guys.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}We should be relieved when we recognize that this is actually the law of the world. Of course, with the development of technology and improvement of our life, there will be less bad guys and less bad behaviours.

Will it go under 500?{ChangeLine}He mentioned Bitstamp a few days ago. In his opinion, Bitstamp is much more reliable than MT for the time being, at least it's not cheating. As for the price, it's hard to say right now.{ChangeLine}He doesn't climb out on much of a limb with that one.{ChangeLine}I wonder why he like IFC so much? a look at it's chart since inception is pretty unimpressive. {ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Good question, why does he favor IFC so much? I collected the author's statements in the poster and translated them into English, the full analysis on IFC is here:{ChangeLine}http://www.bit-sky.com/index.php/english/357-20140222-17-15-special-analysis-on-ifc{ChangeLine}IFC:{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Max money supply: 90,600,000,000{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Price: 0.00048 RMB right now (www.bter.com){ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Block time: 30 seconds{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}As you can see, IFC has a gigantic issue size, an extremely low price and can be confirmed quickly.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}IFC enjoys good popularity in China. There are a lot of IFC websites, forums, and even TV advertisements.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Most important, its mining is coming to an end, only few coins are mined out everyday. This way, the price of IFC will not be pressed by the selling of newly-mined coins, it can rise with much more ease.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}For BTC, newly-mined coins everyday is about 1.6 million dollars, Litecoin 400,000 dollars, Doge 400,000 dollars. For a coin without the selling of newly-mined coins, the price is difficult to fall. On the flip side, even a small amount of buying can pull up the price. As a result, the market maker will be able to pull up the price easily and make much profit.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The author detected the existence of a market maker (on a big Chinese trading platform www.bter.com) in December last year, and successfully predicted his movement of pulling the price from 0.00051 to 0.0097 within 10 hours. Then the market maker somewhat stopped pulling (he is supposed to pull higher and attract new buyers), and began to act against the author, he turned around to lower the price in order to absorb more coins, I guess the reason is that the market maker suddenly saw the poster.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}The author possesses 1.5 billon coins, together with his readers\x92 buying, there are about 10 billion coins. This is the main reason why the market maker acted against him, he wants to grab the coins out of his hands.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}From January 27 to today, the price of IFC has been going down continuously for 25 days. It doesn\\'t fall with BTC, neither does it rise with Doge, it behaved abnormally and began to dive recently(see the chart below)&#65292;now the price is lower than the market maker\x92s position-building cost. It is a golden opportunity to buy in!{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}Despite the author\x92s favor on IFC, he now seems to be sick and tired of playing mind games with the market maker.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}IFC also has its drawbacks, worry about its hashing power, risk of 51% attack, etc.. The author suggested 10% allocation of your money on this coin. You may lose, of course. Anyway, what we are playing is probability.{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine};{ChangeLine}[/quote{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}{ChangeLine}he should look at ADT as well as IFC  ( last cryptsy trading price was around 0.00000050 LTC
